Continued.CHAPTER x. -- A MURMURING.Unable to relieve herself from this perplexity, Cecilia, to divert herchagrin, again visited Miss Belfield. She had then the pleasure to hearthat her brother was much recovered, and had been able, the precedingday, to take an airing, which he had borne so well that Mr Rupil hadcharged him to use the same exercise every morning.ÒAnd will he?Ó said Cecilia.ÒNo, madam, I am sadly afraid not,Ó she answered, Òfor coach hire isvery expensive, and we are willing, now, to save all we can in order tohelp fitting him out for going abroad.ÓCecilia then earnestly entreated her to accept some assistance; but sheassured her she did not dare without the consent of her mother, which,however, she undertook to obtain.The next day, when Cecilia called to hear her success, Mrs Belfield,who hitherto had kept out of sight, made her appearance. She found her,alike in person, manners and conversation, a coarse and ordinary woman,not more unlike her son in talents and acquired accomplishments, thandissimilar to her daughter in softness and natural delicacy.The moment Cecilia was seated, she began, without waiting for anyceremony, or requiring any solicitation, abruptly to talk of heraffairs, and repiningly to relate her misfortunes.ÒI find, madam,Ó she said, Òyou have been so kind as to visit mydaughter Henny a great many times, but as I have no time for company,I have always kept out of the way, having other things to do than sitstill to talk. I have had a sad time of it here, ma'am, with my poorson's illness, having no conveniencies about me, and much ado to makehim mind me; for he's all for having his own way, poor dear soul, andI'm sure I don't know who could contradict him, for it's what I neverhad the heart to do. But then, ma'am, what is to come of it? You see howbad things go! for though I have got a very good income, it won't do forevery thing. And if it was as much again, I should want to save it allnow. For here my poor son, you see, is reduced all in a minute, as onemay say, from being one of the first gentlemen in the town, to a merepoor object, without a farthing in the world!ÓÒHe is, however, I hope now much better in his health?Ó said Cecilia.ÒYes, madam, thank heaven, for if he was worse, those might tell of itthat would, for I'm sure I should never live to hear of it. He has beenthe best son in the world, madam, and used [to] nothing but the bestcompany, for I spared neither pains nor cost to bring him up genteely,and I believe there's not a nobleman in the land that looks morethe gentleman. However, there's come no good of it, for though hisacquaintances was all among the first quality, he never received thevalue of a penny from the best of them. So I have no great need to beproud. But I meant for the best, though I have often enough wished I hadnot meddled in the matter, but left him to be brought up in the shop, ashis father was before him.ÓÒHis present plan, however,Ó said Cecilia, Òwill I hope make you ampleamends both for your sufferings and your tenderness.ÓÒWhat, madam, when he's going to leave me, and settle in foreign parts?If you was a mother yourself, madam, you would not think that such goodamends.ÓÒSettle?Ó said Cecilia. ÒNo, he only goes for a year or two.ÓÒThat's more than I can say, madam, or any body else; and nobody knowswhat may happen in that time. And how I shall keep myself up when he'sbeyond seas, I am sure I don't know, for he has always been the pride ofmy life, and every penny I saved for him, I thought to have been paid inpounds.ÓÒYou will still have your daughter, and she seems so amiable, that I amsure you can want no consolation she will not endeavour to give you.ÓÒBut what is a daughter, madam, to such a son as mine? a son that Ithought to have seen living like a prince, and sending his own coach forme to dine with him! And now he's going to be taken away from me, andnobody knows if I shall live till he comes back. But I may thank myself,for if I had but been content to see him brought up in the shop--yet allthe world would have cried shame upon it, for when he was quite a childin arms, the people used all to say he was born to be a gentleman, andwould live to make many a fine lady's heart ache.ÓÒIf he can but make your heart easy,Ó said Cecilia, smiling, Òwe willnot grieve that the fine ladies should escape the prophecy.ÓÒO, ma'am, I don't mean by that to say he has been over gay among theladies, for it's a thing I never heard of him; and I dare say if anylady was to take a fancy to him, she'd find there was not a modesteryoung man in the world. But you must needs think what a hardship it isto me to have him turn out so unlucky, after all I have done for him,when I thought to have seen him at the top of the tree, as one may say!ÓÒHe will yet, I hope,Ó said Cecilia, Òmake you rejoice in all yourkindness to him; his health is already returning, and his affairs wearagain a more prosperous aspect.ÓÒBut do you suppose, ma'am, that having him sent two or three hundredmiles away from me; with some young master to take care of, is the wayto make up to me what I have gone through for him? why I used to denymyself every thing in the world, in order to save money to buy him smartcloaths, and let him go to the Opera, and Ranelagh, and such sort ofplaces, that he might keep himself in fortune's way! and now you see theend of it! here he is, in a little shabby room up two pairs of stairs,with not one of the great folks coming near him, to see if he's so muchas dead or alive.ÓÒI do not wonder,Ó said Cecilia, Òthat you resent their shewing solittle gratitude for the pleasure and entertainment they have formerlyreceived from him but comfort yourself that it will at least secureyou from any similar disappointment, as Mr Belfield will, in future, beguarded from forming such precarious expectations.ÓÒBut what good will that do me, ma'am, for all the money he has beenthrowing after them all this while? do you think I would have scraped itup for him, and gone without every thing in the world, to see it all endin this manner? why he might as well have been brought up the commonestjourneyman, for any comfort I shall have of him at this rate. Andsuppose he should be drowned in going beyond seas? what am I to dothen?ÓÒYou must not,Ó said Cecilia, Òindulge such fears; I doubt not but yourson will return well, and return all that you wish.ÓÒNobody knows that, ma'am; and the only way to be certain is for him notto go at all; and I'm surprised, ma'am, you can wish him to make such ajourney to nobody knows where, with nothing but a young master that hemust as good as teach his A. B. C. all the way they go!ÓÒCertainly,Ó said Cecilia, amazed at this accusation, ÒI should notwish him to go abroad, if any thing more eligible could be, done by hisremaining in England but as no prospect of that sort seems before him,you must endeavour to reconcile yourself to parting with him.ÓÒYes, but how am I to do that, when I don't know if ever I shall see himagain? Who could have thought of his living so among the great folks,and then coming to want! I'm sure I thought they'd have provided forhim like a son of their own, for he used to go about to all the publicplaces just as they did themselves. Day after day I used to be countingfor when he would come to tell me he'd got a place at court, orsomething of that sort, for I never could tell what it would be; andthen the next news I heard, was that he was shut up in this poor bit ofplace, with nobody troubling their heads about him! however, I'll neverbe persuaded but he might have done better, if he would but have spokea good word for himself, or else have let me done it for him; insteadof which, he never would so much as let me see any of his grand friends,though I would not have made the least scruple in the world to haveasked them for any thing he had a mind to.ÓCecilia again endeavoured to give her comfort; but finding her onlysatisfaction was to express her discontent, she arose to take leave.But, turning first to Miss Belfield, contrived to make a privateenquiry whether she might repeat her offer of assistance. A downcast anddejected look answering in the affirmative, she put into her hand a tenpound bank note, and wishing them good morning, hurried out of the room.Miss Belfield was running after her, but stopt by her mother, who calledout, ÒWhat is it?--How much is it?--Let me look at it!Ó--And then,following Cecilia herself, she thanked her aloud all the way down stairsfor her genteelness, assuring her she would not fail making it known toher son.Cecilia at this declaration turned back, and exhorted her by no meansto mention it; after which she got into her chair, and returned home;pitying Miss Belfield for the unjust partiality shewn to her brother,and excusing the proud shame he had manifested of his relations, fromthe vulgarity and selfishness of her who was at the head of them.Almost a fortnight had now elapsed since her explanation with youngDelvile, yet not once had he been in Portman-square, though in thefortnight which had preceded, scarce a day had passed which had notafforded him some pretence for calling there.At length a note arrived from Mrs Delvile. It contained the mostflattering reproaches for her long absence, and a pressing invitationthat she would dine and spend the next day with her.Cecilia, who had merely denied herself the pleasure of this visit froman apprehension of seeming too desirous of keeping up the connection,now, from the same sense of propriety, determined upon making it,wishing equally to avoid all appearance of consciousness, either byseeking or avoiding the intimacy of the family.Not a little was her anxiety to know in what manner young Delvile wouldreceive her, whether he would be grave or gay, agitated, as during theirlast conversation, or easy, as in the meetings which had preceded it.She found Mrs Delvile, however, alone; and, extremely kind to her, yetmuch surprised, and half displeased, that she had so long been absent.Cecilia, though somewhat distressed what excuses to offer, was happy tofind herself so highly in favour, and not very reluctant to promise morefrequent visits in future.They were then summoned to dinner; but still no young Delvile wasvisible; they were joined only by his father, and she found that no oneelse was expected.Her astonishment now was greater than ever, and she could account by nopossible conjecture for a conduct so extraordinary. Hitherto, whenevershe had visited in St James's-square by appointment, the air with whichhe had received her, constantly announced that he had impatiently waitedher arrival; he had given up other engagements to stay with her, hehad openly expressed his hopes that she would never be long absent,and seemed to take a pleasure in her society to which every other wasinferior. And now, how striking the difference! he forbore all visits atthe house where she resided, he even flew from his own when he knew shewas approaching it!Nor was this the only vexation of which this day was productive; MrDelvile, when the servants were withdrawn after dinner, expressed someconcern that he had been called from her during their last conversation,and added that he would take the present opportunity to talk with herupon some matters of importance.He then began the usual parading prelude, which, upon all occasions, hethought necessary, in order to enhance the value of his interposition,remind her of her inferiority, and impress her with a deeper sense ofthe honour which his guardianship conferred upon her after which, heproceeded to make a formal enquiry whether she had positively dismissedSir Robert Floyer?She assured him she had.ÒI understood my Lord Ernolf,Ó said he, Òthat you had totallydiscouraged the addresses of his son?ÓÒYes, Sir,Ó answered Cecilia, Òfor I never mean to receive them.ÓÒHave you, then, any other engagement?ÓÒNo, Sir,Ó cried she, colouring between shame and displeasure, Ònone atall.ÓÒThis is a very extraordinary circumstance!Ó replied he; Òthe son ofan earl to be rejected by a young woman of no family, and yet no reasonassigned for it!ÓThis contemptuous speech so cruelly shocked Cecilia, that though hecontinued to harangue her for a great part of the afternoon, she onlyanswered him when compelled by some question, and was so evidentlydiscomposed, that Mrs Delvile, who perceived her uneasiness with muchconcern, redoubled her civilities and caresses, and used every method inher power to oblige and enliven her.Cecilia was not ungrateful for her care, and shewed her sense of it byadded respect and attention; but her mind was disturbed, and she quittedthe house as soon as she was able.Mr Delvile's speech, from her previous knowledge of the extremehaughtiness of his character, would not have occasioned her the smallestemotion, had it merely related to him or to herself; but as it concernedLord Ernolf, she regarded it as also concerning his son, and she foundthat, far from trying to promote the union Mr Monckton had told her hehad planned, he did not seem even to think of it, but, on the contrary,proposed and seconded with all his interest another alliance.This, added to the behaviour of young Delvile, made her suspect thatsome engagement was in agitation on his own part, and that while shethought him so sedulous only to avoid her, he was simply occupied inseeking another. This painful suggestion, which every thing seemed toconfirm, again overset all her schemes, and destroyed all her visionaryhappiness. Yet how to reconcile it with what had passed at their lastmeeting she knew not; she had then every reason to believe that hisheart was in her power, and that courage, or an opportunity moreseasonable, was all he wanted to make known his devotion to her; why,then, shun if he loved her? why, if he loved her not, seem so perturbedat the explanation of her independence?A very little time, however, she hoped would unravel this mystery; intwo days, the entertainment which Mr Harrel had planned, to deceive theworld by an appearance of affluence to which he had lost all title, wasto take place; young Delvile, in common with every other person who hadever been seen at the house, had early received an invitation, which hehad readily promised to accept some time before the conversation thatseemed the period of their acquaintance had passed. Should he, afterbeing so long engaged, fail to keep his appointment, she could no longerhave any doubt of the justice of her conjecture; should he, on thecontrary, again appear, from his behaviour and his looks she mightperhaps be able to gather why he had so long been absent.BOOK V.CHAPTER i. -- A ROUT.The day at length arrived of which the evening and the entrance ofcompany were, for the first time, as eagerly wished by Cecilia as by herdissipated host and hostess. No expence and no pains had been spared torender this long projected entertainment splendid and elegant; it was tobegin with a concert, which was to be followed by a ball, and succeededby a supper.Cecilia, though unusually anxious about her own affairs, was notso engrossed by them as to behold with indifference a scene of suchunjustifiable extravagance; it contributed to render her thoughtful anduneasy, and to deprive her of all mental power of participating in thegaiety of the assembly. Mr Arnott was yet more deeply affected by themad folly of the scheme, and received from the whole evening no othersatisfaction than that which a look of sympathetic concern from Ceciliaoccasionally afforded him.Till nine o'clock no company appeared, except Sir Robert Floyer,who stayed from dinner time, and Mr Morrice, who having received aninvitation for the evening, was so much delighted with the permissionto again enter the house, that he made use of it between six andseven o'clock, and before the family had left the dining parlour. Heapologized with the utmost humility to Cecilia for the unfortunateaccident at the Pantheon; but as to her it had been productive ofnothing but pleasure, by exciting in young Delvile the most flatteringalarm for her safety, she found no great difficulty in according him herpardon.Among those who came in the first crowd was Mr Monckton, who, had hebeen equally unconscious of sinister views, would in following his owninclination, have been as early in his attendance as Mr Morrice; butwho, to obviate all suspicious remarks, conformed to the fashionabletardiness of the times.Cecilia's chief apprehension for the evening was that Sir Robert Floyerwould ask her to dance with him, which she could not refuse withoutsitting still during the ball, nor accept, after the reports she knewto be spread, without seeming to give a public sanction to them. To MrMonckton therefore, innocently considering him as a married man and herold friend, she frankly told her distress, adding, by way of excuse forthe hint, that the partners were to be changed every two dances.Mr Monckton, though his principal study was carefully to avoid allpublic gallantry or assiduity towards Cecilia, had not the forbearanceto resist this intimation, and therefore she had the pleasure of tellingSir Robert, when he asked the honour of her hand for the two firstdances, that she was already engaged.She then expected that he would immediately secure her for the twofollowing; but, to her great joy, he was so much piqued by the evidentpleasure with which she announced her engagement, that he proudly walkedaway without adding another word.Much satisfied with this arrangement, and not without hopes that, ifshe was at liberty when he arrived, she might be applied to by youngDelvile, she now endeavoured to procure herself a place in the musicroom.This, with some difficulty, she effected; but though there was anexcellent concert, in which several capital performers played and sung,she found it impossible to hear a note, as she chanced to be seated justby Miss Leeson, and two other young ladies, who were paying one anothercompliments upon their dress and their looks, settling to dance in thesame cotillon, guessing who would begin the minuets, and wonderingthere were not more gentlemen. Yet, in the midst of this unmeaningconversation, of which she remarked that Miss Leeson bore the principalpart, not one of them failed, from time to time, to exclaim with greatrapture ÒWhat sweet music!--Ó ÒOh! how charming!Ó ÒDid you ever hear anything so delightful?--ÓÒAh,Ó said Cecilia to Mr Gosport, who now approached her, Òbut for yourexplanatory observations, how much would the sudden loquacity of thissupercilious lady, whom I had imagined all but dumb, have perplext me!ÓÒThose who are most silent to strangers,Ó answered Mr Gosport, Òcommonlytalk most fluently to their intimates, for they are deeply in arrears,and eager to pay off their debts. Miss Leeson now is in her proper set,and therefore appears in her natural character; and the poor girl's joyin being able to utter all the nothings she has painfully hoarded whileseparated from her coterie, gives to her now the wild transport of abird just let loose from a cage. I rejoice to see the little creatureat liberty, for what can be so melancholy as a forced appearance ofthinking, where there are no materials for such an occupation?ÓSoon after, Miss Larolles, who was laughing immoderately, contrived tocrowd herself into their party, calling out to them, ÒO you have had thegreatest loss in the world! if you had but been in the next room justnow!--there's the drollest figure there you can conceive; enough tofrighten one to look at him.Ó And presently she added ÒO Lord, if youstoop a little this way, you may see him!ÓThen followed a general tittering, accompanied with exclamations ofÒLord, what a fright!Ó ÒIt's enough to kill one with laughing to look athim!Ó ÒDid you ever see such a horrid creature in your life?Ó And soonafter, one of them screamed out ÒO Lord, see!--he's grinning at MissBeverley!ÓCecilia then turned her head towards the door, and there, to her ownas well as her neighbours' amazement, she perceived Mr Briggs! who, inorder to look about him at his ease, was standing upon a chair, fromwhich, having singled her out, he was regarding her with a facetioussmirk, which, when it caught her eye, was converted into a familiar nod.She returned his salutation, but was not much charmed to observe, thatpresently descending from his exalted post, which had moved the wonderand risibility of all the company, he made a motion to approach her; forwhich purpose, regardless of either ladies or gentlemen in his way, hesturdily pushed forward, with the same unconcerned hardiness he wouldhave forced himself through a crowd in the street; and taking not thesmallest notice of their frowns, supplications that he would standstill, and exclamations of ÒPray, Sir!Ó--ÒLord, how troublesome!Ó andÒSir, I do assure you here's no room!Ó he fairly and adroitly elbowedthem from him till he reached her seat; and then, with a waggish grin,he looked round, to show he had got the better, and to see whom he haddiscomposed.When he had enjoyed this triumph, he turned to Cecilia, and chucking herunder the chin, said ÒWell, my little duck, how goes it? got to you atlast; squeezed my way; would not be nicked; warrant I'll mob with thebest of them! Look here! all in a heat!--hot as the dog days.ÓAnd then, to the utter consternation of the company, he took off his wigto wipe his head! which occasioned such universal horror, that all whowere near the door escaped into other, apartments, while those who weretoo much enclosed, for flight, with one accord turned away their heads.Captain Aresby, being applied to by some of the ladies to remonstrateupon this unexampled behaviour, advanced to him, and said, ÒI amquite abim, Sir, to incommode you, but the commands of the ladies areinsuperable. Give me leave, Sir, to entreat that you would put on yourwig.ÓÒMy wig?Ó cried he, Òay, ay, shall in a moment, only want to wipe myhead first.ÓÒI am quite assomm, Sir,Ó returned the Captain, Òto disturb you, butI must really hint you don't comprehend me; the ladies are extremelyinconvenienced by these sort of sights, and we make it a principle theyshould never be accables with them.ÓÒAnan!Ó cried Mr Briggs, staring.ÒI say, Sir,Ó replied the Captain, Òthe ladies are quite au desespoirthat you will not cover your head.ÓÒWhat for?Ó cried he, Òwhat's the matter with my head? ne'er a man heregot a better! very good stuff in it; won't change it with ne'er a one ofyou!ÓAnd then, half unconscious of the offence he had given, and half angryat the rebuke he had received, he leisurely compleated his design, andagain put on his wig, settling it to his face with as much composure asif he had performed the operation in his own dressing-room.The Captain, having gained his point, walked away, making, however,various grimaces of disgust, and whispering from side to side Òhe's themost petrifying fellow I ever was obsed by!ÓMr Briggs then, with much derision, and sundry distortions ofcountenance, listened to an Italian song; after which, he bustled backto the outer apartment, in search of Cecilia, who, ashamed of seeminga party in the disturbance he had excited, had taken the opportunity ofhis dispute with the Captain, to run into the next room; where, however,he presently found her, while she was giving an account to Mr Gosportof her connection with him, to which Morrice, ever curious and eager toknow what was going forward, was also listening.ÒAh, little chick!Ó cried he, Ògot to you again! soon out jostle thosejemmy sparks! But where's the supper? see nothing of the supper! Time togo to bed,--suppose there is none; all a take in; nothing but a littlepiping.ÓÒSupper, Sir?Ó cried Cecilia; Òthe Concert is not over yet. Was suppermentioned in your card of invitation?ÓÒAy, to be sure, should not have come else. Don't visit often; alwayscosts money. Wish I had not come now; wore a hole in my shoe; hardly acrack in it before.ÓÒWhy you did not walk, Sir?ÓÒDid, did; why not? Might as well have stayed away though; daubed mybest coat, like to have spoilt it.ÓÒSo much the better for the taylors, Sir,Ó said Morrice, pertly, Òforthen you must have another.ÓÒAnother! what for? ha'n't had this seven years; just as good as new.ÓÒI hope,Ó said Cecilia, Òyou had not another fall?ÓÒWorse, worse; like to have lost my bundle.ÓÒWhat bundle, Sir?ÓÒBest coat and waistcoat; brought 'em in my handkerchief, purpose tosave them. When will Master Harrel do as much?ÓÒBut had you no apprehensions, Sir,Ó said Mr Gosport drily, Òthat thehandkerchief would be the sooner worn out for having a knot tied in it?ÓÒTook care of that, tied it slack. Met an unlucky boy; little dog gaveit a pluck; knot slipt; coat and waistcoat popt out.ÓÒBut what became of the boy, Sir?Ó cried Morrice, ÒI hope he got off?ÓÒCould not run for laughing; caught him in a minute; gave him somethingto laugh for; drubbed him soundly.ÓÒO poor fellow!Ó cried Morrice with a loud hallow, ÒI am really sorryfor him. But pray, Sir, what became of your best coat and waistcoatwhile you gave him this drubbing? did you leave them in the dirt?ÓÒNo, Mr Nincompoop,Ó answered Briggs angrily, ÒI put them on a stall.ÓÒThat was a perilous expedient, Sir,Ó said Mr Gosport, Òand I shouldfear might be attended with ill consequences, for the owner of the stallwould be apt to expect some little doueur. How did you manage, Sir?ÓÒBought a halfpenny worth of apples. Serve for supper to-morrow night.ÓÒBut how, Sir, did you get your cloaths dried, or cleaned?ÓÒWent to an alehouse; cost me half a pint.ÓÒAnd pray, Sir,Ó cried Morrice, Òwhere, at last, did you make yourtoilette?ÓÒSha'n't tell, sha'n't tell; ask no more questions. What signifies wherea man slips on a coat and waist-coat?ÓÒWhy, Sir, this will prove an expensive expedition to you,Ó said MrGosport, very gravely; ÒHave you cast up what it may cost you?ÓÒMore than it's worth, more than it's worth,Ó answered he pettishlyÒha'n't laid out so much in pleasure these five years.ÓÒHa! ha!Ó cried Morrice, hallowing aloud, Òwhy it can't be more thansixpence in all!ÓÒSixpence?Ó repeated he scornfully, Òif you don't know the value ofsixpence, you'll never be worth fivepence three farthings. How do thinkgot rich, hay?--by wearing fine coats, and frizzling my pate? No, no;Master Harrel for that! ask him if he'll cast an account with me!--neverknew a man worth a penny with such a coat as that on.ÓMorrice again laughed, and again Mr Briggs reproved him; and Cecilia,taking advantage of the squabble, stole back to the music-room. Here, ina few minutes, Mrs Panton, a lady who frequently visited at the house,approached Cecilia, followed by a gentleman, whom she had never beforeseen, but who was so evidently charmed with her, that he had lookedat no other object since his entrance into the house. Mrs Panton,presenting him to her by the name of Mr Marriot, told her he had beggedher intercession for the honour of her hand in the two first dances; andthe moment she answered that she was already engaged, the same requestwas made for the two following. Cecilia had then no excuse, and wastherefore obliged to accept him.The hope she had entertained in the early part of the evening, wasalready almost wholly extinguished; Delvile appeared not! though hereye watched the entrance of every new visitor, and her vexation made herbelieve that he alone, of all the town, was absent.When the Concert was over, the company joined promiscuously for chatand refreshments before the ball; and Mr Gosport advanced to Cecilia, torelate a ridiculous dispute which had just passed between Mr Briggs andMorrice.ÒYou, Mr Gosport,Ó said Cecilia, Òwho seem to make the minutiae ofabsurd characters your study, can explain to me, perhaps, why Mr Briggsseems to have as much pleasure in proclaiming his meanness, as inboasting his wealth?ÓÒBecause,Ó answered Mr Gosport, Òhe knows them, in his own affairs,to be so nearly allied, that but for practising the one, he hadnever possessed the other; ignorant, therefore, of alldiscrimination,--except, indeed, of pounds, shillings and pence!--hesupposes them necessarily inseparable, because with him they wereunited. What you, however, call meanness, he thinks wisdom, andrecollects, therefore, not with shame but with triumph, the variouslittle arts and subterfuges by which his coffers have been filled.ÓHere Lord Ernolf, concluding Cecilia still disengaged from seeing heronly discourse with Mr Gosport and Mr Monckton, one of them was oldenough to be her father, and the other was a married man, advanced,and presenting to her Lord Derford, his son, a youth not yet of age,solicited for him the honour of her hand as his partner.Cecilia, having a double excuse, easily declined this proposal; LordErnolf, however, was too earnest to be repulsed, and told her he shouldagain try his interest when her two present engagements were fulfilled.Hopeless, now, of young Delvile, she heard this intimation withindifference; and was accompanying Mr Monckton into the ballroom, whenMiss Larolles, flying towards her with an air of infinite eagerness,caught her hand, and said in a whisper Òpray let me wish you joy!ÓÒCertainly!Ó said Cecilia, Òbut pray let me ask you of what?ÓÒO Lord, now,Ó answered she, ÒI am sure you know what I mean; but youmust know I have a prodigious monstrous great favour to beg of you; nowpray don't refuse me; I assure you if you do, I shall be so mortifiedyou've no notion.ÓÒWell, what is it?ÓÒNothing but to let me be one of your bride maids. I assure you I shalltake it as the greatest favour in the world.ÓÒMy bride maid!Ó cried Cecilia; Òbut do you not think the bridegroomhimself will be rather offended to find a bridesmaid appointed, beforehe is even thought of?ÓÒO pray, now,Ó cried she, Òdon't be ill-natured, for if you are, you'veno idea how I shall be disappointed. Only conceive what happened to methree weeks ago! you must know I was invited to Miss Clinton's wedding,and so I made up a new dress on purpose, in a very particular sort ofshape, quite of my own invention, and it had the sweetest effect you canconceive; well, and when the time came, do you know her mother happenedto die! Never any thing was so excessive unlucky, for now she won't bemarried this half year, and my dress will be quite old and yellow; forit's all white, and the most beautiful thing you ever saw in your life.ÓÒUpon my word you are very obliging!Ó cried Cecilia laughing; Òand praydo you make interest regularly round with all your female acquaintanceto be married upon this occasion, or am I the only one you think thisdistress will work upon?ÓÒNow how excessive teazing!Ó cried Miss Larolles, Òwhen you know so wellwhat I mean, and when all the town knows as well as myself.ÓCecilia then seriously enquired whether she had really any meaning atall.ÒLord yes,Ó answered she, Òyou know I mean about Sir Robert Floyer; forI'm told you've quite refused Lord Derford.ÓÒAnd are you also told that I have accepted Sir Robert Floyer?ÓÒO dear yes!--the jewels are bought, and the equipages are built; it'squite a settled thing, I know very well.ÓCecilia then very gravely began an attempt to undeceive her; but thedancing beginning also at the same time, she stayed not to hear her,hurrying, with a beating heart, to the place of action. Mr Monckton andhis fair partner then followed, mutually exclaiming against Mr Harrel'simpenetrable conduct; of which Cecilia, however, in a short timeceased wholly to think, for as soon as the first cotillon was over, sheperceived young Delvile just walking into the room.Surprise, pleasure and confusion assailed her all at once; she hadentirely given up her expectation of seeing him, and an absence sodetermined had led her to conclude he had pursuits which ought to makeher join in wishing it lengthened; but now he appeared, that conclusion,with the fears that gave rise to it, vanished; and she regretted nothingbut the unfortunate succession of engagements which would prevent herdancing with him at all, and probably keep off all conversation with himtill supper time.She soon, however, perceived a change in his air and behaviour thatextremely astonished her; he looked grave and thoughtful, saluted herat a distance, shewed no sign of any intention to approach her, regardedthe dancing and dancers as a public spectacle in which he had no chanceof personal interest, and seemed wholly altered, not merely with respectto her, but to himself, as his former eagerness for her society was notmore abated than [his] former general gaiety.She had no time, however, for comments, as she was presently calledto the second cotillon; but the confused and unpleasant ideas which,without waiting for time or reflection, crowded upon her imaginationon observing his behaviour, were not more depressing to herself, thanobvious to her partner; Mr Monckton by the change in her countenancefirst perceived the entrance of young Delvile, and by her apparentemotion and uneasiness, readily penetrated into the state of her mind;he was confirmed that her affections were engaged; he saw, too, that shewas doubtful with what return.The grief with which he made the first discovery, was somewhat lessenedby the hopes he conceived from, the second; yet the evening was to himas painful as to Cecilia, since he now knew that whatever prosperity'might ultimately attend his address and assiduity, her heart was nother own to bestow; and that even were he sure of young Delvile'sindifference, and actually at liberty to make proposals for himself,the time of being first in her esteem was at an end, and the long-earnedgood opinion which he had hoped would have ripened into affection, mightnow be wholly undermined by the sudden impression of a lively stranger,without trouble to himself, and perhaps without pleasure!Reflections such as these wholly embittered the delight he had promisedhimself from dancing with her, and took from him all power to combat theanxiety with which she was seized; when the second cotillon, therefore,was over, instead of following her to a seat, or taking the privilege ofhis present situation to converse with her, the jealousy rising in hisbreast robbed him of all satisfaction, and gave to him no other desirethan to judge its justice by watching her motions at a distance.Mean while Cecilia, inattentive whether he accompanied or quitted herproceeded to the first vacant seat. Young Delvile was standing near it,and, in a short time, but rather as if he could not avoid than as if hewished it, he came to enquire how she did.The simplest question, in the then situation of her mind, was sufficientto confuse her, and though she answered, she hardly knew what he hadasked. A minute's recollection, however, restored an apparent composure,and she talked to him of Mrs Delvile, with her usual partial regardfor that lady, and with an earnest endeavour to seem unconscious of anyalteration in his behaviour.Yet, to him, even this trifling and general conversation was evidentlypainful, and he looked relieved by the approach of Sir Robert Floyer,who soon after joined them.At this time a young lady who was sitting by Cecilia, called to aservant who was passing, for a glass of lemonade; Cecilia desiredhe would bring her one also; but Delvile, not sorry to break off thediscourse, said he would himself be her cup-bearer, and for that purposewent away.A moment after, the servant returned with some lemonade to Cecilia'sneighbour, and Sir Robert, taking a glass from him, brought it toCecilia at the very instant young Delvile came with another.ÒI think I am before hand with you, Sir,Ó said the insolent Baronet.ÒNo, Sir,Ó answered young Delvile, ÒI think we were both in together;Miss Beverley, however, is steward of the race, and we must submit toher decision.ÓÒWell, madam,Ó cried Sir Robert, Òhere we stand, waiting your pleasure.Which is to be the happy man!ÓÒEach, I hope,Ó answered Cecilia, with admirable presence of mind,Òsince I expect no less than that you will both do me the honour ofdrinking my health.ÓThis little contrivance, which saved her alike from shewing favour orgiving offence, could not but be applauded by both parties; and whilethey obeyed her orders, she took a third glass herself from the servant.While this was passing, Mr Briggs, again perceiving her, stumpt hastilytowards her, calling out ÒAh ha! my duck! what's that? got somethingnice? Come here, my lad, taste it myself.ÓHe then took a glass, but having only put it to his mouth, made a wryface, and returned it, saying ÒBad! bad! poor punch indeed!--not a dropof rum in it!ÒSo much the better, Sir,Ó cried Morrice, who diverted himself byfollowing him, Òfor then you see the master of the house spares insomething, and you said he spared in nothing.ÓÒDon't spare in fools!Ó returned Mr Briggs, Òkeeps them in plenty.ÓÒNo, Sir, nor in any out of the way characters,Ó answered Morrice.ÒSo much the worse,Ó cried Briggs, Òso much the worse! Eat him out ofhouse and home; won't leave him a rag to his back nor a penny in hispocket. Never mind 'em, my little duck; mind none of your guardians butme; t'other two a'n't worth a rush.ÓCecilia, somewhat ashamed of this speech, looked towards young Delvile,in whom it occasioned the first smile she had seen that evening.ÒBeen looking about for you!Ó continued Briggs, noddingsagaciously; Òbelieve I've found one will do. Guess what Imean;--£100,0000--hay?--what say to that? any thing better at the westend of the town?ÓÒ£100,000!Ó cried Morrice, Òand pray, Sir, who may this be?ÓÒNot you, Mr jackanapes! sure of that. A'n't quite positive he'll haveyou, neither. Think he will, though.ÓÒPray; Sir, what age is he?Ó cried the never daunted Morrice.ÒWhy about--let's see--don't know, never heard,--what signifies?ÓÒBut, Sir, he's an old man, I suppose, by being so rich?ÓÒOld? no, no such thing; about my own standing.ÓÒWhat, Sir, and do you propose him for an husband to Miss Beverley?ÓÒWhy not? know ever a one warmer? think Master Harrel will get her abetter? or t'other old Don, in the grand square?ÓÒIf you please, Sir,Ó cried Cecilia hastily, Òwe will talk of thismatter another time.ÓÒNo, pray,Ó cried young Delvile, who could not forbear laughing, Òlet itbe discussed now.ÓÒHate 'em,Ó continued Mr Briggs, Òhate 'em both! one spending more thanhe's worth, cheated and over-reached by fools, running into gaol toplease a parcel of knaves; t'other counting nothing but uncles andgrandfathers, dealing out fine names instead of cash, casting up morecousins than guineas--ÓAgain Cecilia endeavoured to silence him, but, only chucking her underthe chin, he went on, ÒAy, ay, my little duck, never mind 'em; one of'em i'n't worth a penny, and t'other has nothing in his pockets butlists of the defunct. What good will come of that? would not givetwopence a dozen for 'em! A poor set of grandees, with nothing but atie-wig for their portions!ÓCecilia, unable to bear this harangue in the presence of young Delvile,who, however, laughed it off with a very good grace, arose with anintention to retreat, which being perceived by Sir Robert Floyer, whohad attended to this dialogue with haughty contempt, he came forward,and said, Ònow then, madam, may I have the honour of your hand?ÓÒNo, Sir,Ó answered Cecilia, ÒI am engaged.ÓÒEngaged again?Ó cried he, with the air of a man who thought himselfmuch injured.ÒGlad of it, glad of it!Ó said Mr Briggs; Òserved very right! havenothing to say to him, my chick!ÓÒWhy not, Sir?Ó cried Sir Robert, with an imperious look.ÒSha'n't have her, sha'n't have her! can tell you that; won't consent;know you of old.ÓÒAnd what do you know of me, pray Sir?ÓÒNo good, no good; nothing to say to you; found fault with my nose!ha'n't forgot it.ÓAt this moment Mr Marriot came to claim his partner, who, very willingto quit this scene of wrangling and vulgarity, immediately attendedhim. Miss Larolles, again flying up to her, said ÒO my dear, we are allexpiring to know who that creature is! I never saw such a horrid frightin my life!ÓCecilia was beginning to satisfy her, but some more young ladies comingup to join in the request, she endeavoured to pass on; ÒO but,Ó criedMiss Larolles, detaining her, Òdo pray stop, for I've something to tellyou that's so monstrous you've no idea. Do you know Mr Meadows has notdanced at all! and he's been standing with Mr Sawyer, and looking on allthe time, and whispering and laughing so you've no notion. However, Iassure you, I'm excessive glad he did not ask me, for all I have beensitting still all this time, for I had a great deal rather sit still, Iassure you; only I'm sorry I put on this dress, for any thing would havedone just to look on in that stupid manner.ÓHere Mr Meadows sauntered towards them; and all the young ladiesbegan playing with their fans, and turning their heads another way, todisguise the expectations his approach awakened; and Miss Larolles, ina hasty whisper to Cecilia, cried, ÒPray don't take any notice of whatI said, for if he should happen to ask me, I can't well refuse him, youknow, for if I do, he'll be so excessive affronted you can't think.ÓMr Meadows then, mixing in the little group, began, with sundrygrimaces, to exclaim Òhow intolerably hot it is! there's no such thingas breathing. How can anybody think of dancing! I am amazed Mr Harrelhas not a ventilator in this room. Don't you think it would be a greatimprovement?ÓThis speech, though particularly addressed to no one, receivedimmediately an assenting answer from all the young ladies.Then, turning to Miss Larolles, ÒDon't you dance?Ó he said.ÒMe?Ó cried she, embarrassed, Òyes, I believe so,--really I don'tknow,--I a'n't quite determined.ÓÒO, do dance!Ó cried he, stretching himself and yawning, Òit alwaysgives me spirits to see you.ÓThen, turning suddenly to Cecilia, without any previous ceremony ofrenewing his acquaintance, either by speaking or bowing, he abruptlysaid ÒDo you love dancing, ma'am?ÓÒYes, Sir, extremely well.ÓÒI'm very glad to hear it. You have one thing, then, to softenexistence.ÓÒDo you dislike it yourself?ÓÒWhat dancing? Oh dreadful! how it was ever adopted in a civilizedcountry I cannot find out; 'tis certainly a Barbarian exercise, and ofsavage origin. Don't you think so, Miss Larolles?ÓÒLord no,Ó cried Miss Larolles, ÒI assure you I like it better than anything; I know nothing so delightful, I declare I dare say I could notlive without it; I should be so stupid you can't conceive.ÓÒWhy I remember,Ó said Mr Marriot, Òwhen Mr Meadows was always dancinghimself. Have you forgot, Sir, when you used to wish the night wouldlast for ever, that you might dance without ceasing?ÓMr Meadows, who was now intently surveying a painting that was over thechimney-piece, seemed not to hear this question, but presently calledout ÒI am amazed Mr Harrel can suffer such a picture as this to be inhis house. I hate a portrait, 'tis so wearisome looking at a thing thatis doing nothing!ÓÒDo you like historical pictures, Sir, any better?ÓÒO no, I detest them! views of battles, murders, and death! Shocking!shocking!--I shrink from them with horror!ÓÒPerhaps you are fond of landscapes?ÓÒBy no means! Green trees and fat cows! what do they tell one? I hateevery thing that is insipid.ÓÒYour toleration, then,Ó said Cecilia, Òwill not be very extensive.ÓÒNo,Ó said he, yawning, Òone can tolerate nothing! one's patience iswholly exhausted by the total tediousness of every thing one sees, andevery body one talks with. Don't you find it so, ma'am?ÓÒSometimes!Ó said Cecilia, rather archly.ÒYou are right, ma'am, extremely right; one does not know what in theworld to do with one's self. At home, one is killed with meditation,abroad, one is overpowered by ceremony; no possibility of finding easeor comfort. You never go into public, I think, ma'am?ÓÒWhy not to be much marked, I find!Ó said Cecilia, laughing.ÒO, I beg your pardon! I believe I saw you one evening at Almack's; Ireally beg your pardon, but I had quite forgot it.ÓÒLord, Mr Meadows,Ó said Miss Larolles, Òdon't you know you are meaningthe Pantheon? only conceive how you forget things!ÓÒThe Pantheon, was it? I never know one of those places from another.I heartily wish they were all abolished; I hate public places. 'Tisterrible to be under the same roof with a set of people who would carenothing if they saw one expiring!ÓÒYou are, at least, then, fond of the society of your friends?ÓÒO no! to be worn out by seeing always the same faces!--one is sick todeath of friends; nothing makes one so melancholy.ÓCecilia now went to join the dancers, and Mr Meadows, turning to MissLarolles, said, ÒPray don't let me keep you from dancing; I am afraidyou'll lose your place.ÓÒNo,Ó cried she, bridling, ÒI sha'n't dance at all.ÓÒHow cruel!Ó cried he, yawning, Òwhen you know how it exhilarates meto see you! Don't you think this room is very close? I must go and tryanother atmosphere,--But I hope you will relent, and dance?ÓAnd then, stretching his arms as if half asleep, he sauntered into thenext room, where he flung himself upon a sofa till the ball was over.The new partner of Cecilia, who was a wealthy, but very simple youngman, used his utmost efforts to entertain and oblige her, and, flatteredby the warmth of his own desire, he fancied that he succeeded; though,in a state of such suspence and anxiety, a man of brighter talents hadfailed.At the end of the two dances, Lord Ernolf again attempted to engage herfor his son, but she now excused herself from dancing any more, andsat quietly as a spectatress till the rest of the company gave over. MrMarriot, however, would not quit her, and she was compelled to supportwith him a trifling conversation, which, though irksome to herself, tohim, who had not seen her in her happier hour, was delightful.She expected every instant to be again joined by young Delvile, butthe expectation was disappointed; he came not; she concluded he was inanother apartment; the company was summoned to supper, she then thoughtit impossible to miss him; but, after waiting and looking for him invain, she found he had already left the house.The rest of the evening she scarce knew what passed, for she attendedto nothing; Mr Monckton might watch, and Mr Briggs might exhort her, SirRobert might display his insolence, or Mr Marriot his gallantry,--allwas equally indifferent, and equally unheeded; and before half thecompany left the house, she retired to her own room.She spent the night in the utmost disturbance; the occurrences of theevening with respect to young Delvile she looked upon as decisive; ifhis absence had chagrined her, his presence had still more shocked her,since, while she was left to conjecture, though she had fears she hadhopes, and though all she saw was gloomy, all she expected was pleasant;but they had now met, and those expectations proved fallacious. She knewnot, indeed, how to account for the strangeness of his conduct; but inseeing it was strange, she was convinced it was unfavourable; he hadevidently avoided her while it was in his power, and when, at last, hewas obliged to meet her, he was formal, distant, and reserved.The more she recollected and dwelt upon the difference of his behaviourin their preceding meeting, the more angry as well as amazed she becameat the change, and though she still concluded the pursuit of some otherobject occasioned it, she could find no excuse for his fickleness ifthat pursuit was recent, nor for his caprice if it was anterior.CHAPTER ii. -- A BROAD HINT.The next day Cecilia, to drive Delvile a little from her thoughts,which she now no longer wished him to occupy, again made a visit to MissBelfield, whose society afforded her more consolation than any other shecould procure.She found her employed in packing up, and preparing to remove to anotherlodging, for her brother, she said, was so much better, that he did notthink it right to continue in so disgraceful a situation.She talked with her accustomed openness of her affairs, and the interestwhich Cecilia involuntarily took in them, contributed to lessen hervexation in thinking of her own. ÒThe generous friend of my brother,Ó said she, Òwho, though but a new acquaintance to him, has courted himin all his sorrows, when every body else forsook him, has brought him atlast into a better way of thinking. He says there is a gentleman whoseson is soon going abroad, who he is almost sure will like my brothervastly, and in another week, he is to be introduced to him. And so, ifmy mother can but reconcile herself to parting with him, perhaps we mayall do well again.ÓÒYour mother,Ó said Cecilia, Òwhen he is gone, will better know thevalue of the blessing she has left in her daughter.ÓÒO no, madam, no; she is wrapt up in him, and cares nothing for all theworld besides. It was always so, and we have all of us been used to it.But we have had a sad scene since you were so kind as to come last; forwhen she told him what you had done, he was almost out of his senseswith anger that we had acquainted you with his distress, and he said itwas publishing his misery, and undoing whatever his friend or himselfcould do, for it was making him ashamed to appear in the world, evenwhen his affairs might be better. But I told him again and again thatyou had as much sweetness as goodness, and instead of hurting hisreputation, would do him nothing but credit.ÓÒI am sorry,Ó said Cecilia, ÒMrs Belfield mentioned the circumstanceat all; it would have been better, for many reasons, that he should nothave heard of it.ÓÒShe hoped it would please him,Ó answered Miss Belfield, Òhowever, hemade us both promise we would take no such step in future, for he saidwe were not reduced to so much indigence, whatever he was; and that asto our accepting money from other people, that we might save up our ownfor him, it would be answering no purpose, for he should think himself amonster to make use of it.ÓÒAnd what said your mother?ÓÒWhy she gave him a great many promises that she would never vex himabout it again; and indeed, much as I know we are obliged to you, madam,and gratefully as I am sure I would lay down my life to serve you, I amvery glad in this case that my brother has found it out. For though I somuch wish him to do something for himself, and not to be so proud, andlive in a manner he has no right to do, I think, for all that, that itis a great disgrace to my' poor father's honest memory, to have us turnbeggars after his death, when he left us all so well provided for, if wehad but known how to be satisfied.ÓÒThere is a natural rectitude in your heart,Ó said Cecilia, Òthat theablest casuists could not mend.ÓShe then enquired whither they were removing, and Miss Belfield told herto Portland Street, Oxford Road, where they were to have two apartmentsup two pair of stairs, and the use of a very good parlour, in which herbrother might see his friends. ÒAnd this,Ó added she, Òis a luxury forwhich nobody can blame him, because if he has not the appearance of adecent home, no gentleman will employ him.ÓThe Padington house, she said, was already let, and her mother wasdetermined not to hire another, but still to live as penuriously aspossible, in order, notwithstanding his remonstrances, to save all shecould of her income for her son.Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs Belfield,who very familiarly said she came to tell Cecilia they were all in thewrong box in letting her son know of the £10 bank note, Òfor,Ó continuedshe, Òhe has a pride that would grace a duke, and he thinks nothing ofhis hardships, so long as nobody knows of them. So another time we mustmanage things better, and when we do him any good, not let him know aword of the matter. We'll settle it all among ourselves, and one day orother he'll be glad enough to thank us.ÓCecilia, who saw Miss Belfield colour with shame at the freedom of thishint, now arose to depart; but Mrs Belfield begged her not to go sosoon, and pressed her with such urgency to again sit down, that she wasobliged to comply.She then began a warm commendation of her son, lavishly praising all hisgood qualities, and exalting even his defects, concluding with sayingÒBut, ma'am, for all he's such a complete gentleman, and for all he'smade so much of, he was so diffident, I could not get him to call andthank you for the present you made him, though, when he went his lastairing, I almost knelt to him to do it. But, with all his merit, hewants as much encouragement as a lady, for I can tell you it is not alittle will do for him.ÓCecilia, amazed at this extraordinary speech, looked from the mother tothe daughter in order to discover its meaning, which, however, was soonrendered plainer by what followed.ÒBut pray now, ma'am, don't think him the more ungrateful for hisshyness, for young ladies so high in the world as you are, must gopretty good lengths before a young man will get courage to speak tothem. And though I have told my son over and over that the ladies neverlike a man the worse for being a little bold, he's so much down in themouth that it has no effect upon him. But it all comes of his beingbrought up at the university, for that makes him think he knows betterthan I can tell him. And so, to be sure, he does. However, for all that,it is a hard thing upon a mother to find all she says goes just fornothing. But I hope you'll excuse him, ma'am, for it's nothing in theworld but his over-modesty.ÓCecilia now stared with a look of so much astonishment and displeasure,that Mrs Belfield, suspecting she had gone rather too far, added ÒI begyou won't take what I've said amiss, ma'am, for we mothers of familiesare more used to speak out than maiden ladies. And I should not havesaid so much, but only I was afraid you would misconstrue my son'sbackwardness, and so that he might be flung out of your favour at last,and all for nothing but having too much respect for you.ÓÒO dear mother!Ó cried Miss Belfield, whose face was the colour ofscarlet, Òpray!Ó--ÒWhat's the matter now?Ó cried Mrs Belfield; Òyou are as shy asyour brother; and if we are all to be so, when are we to come to anunderstanding?ÓÒNot immediately, I believe indeed,Ó said Cecilia, rising, Òbut that wemay not plunge deeper in our mistakes, I will for the present take myleave.ÓÒNo, ma'am,Ó cried Mrs Belfield, stopping her, Òpray don't go yet, forI've got a great many things I want to talk to you about. In the firstplace, ma'am, pray what is your opinion of this scheme for sending myson abroad into foreign parts? I don't know what you may think of it,but as to me, it half drives me out of my senses to have him taken awayfrom me at last in that unnatural manner. And I'm sure, ma'am, if youwould only put in a word against it, I dare say he would give it upwithout a demur.ÓÒMe?Ó cried Cecilia, disengaging herself from her hold, ÒNo, madam, youmust apply to those friends who better understand his affairs, and whowould have a deeper interest in detaining him.ÓÒLack a day!Ó cried Mrs Belfield, with scarcely smothered vexation, Òhowhard it is to make these grand young ladies come to reason! As to myson's other friends, what good will it do for him to mind what they say?who can expect him to give up his journey, without knowing what amendshe shall get for it?ÓÒYou must settle this matter with him at your leisure,Ó said Cecilia, ÒIcannot now stay another moment.ÓMrs Belfield, again finding she had been too precipitate, tried to drawback, saying ÒPray, ma'am, don't let what I have mentioned go against myson in your good opinion, for he knows no more of it than the furthestperson in the world, as my daughter can testify for as to shyness,he's just as shy as a lady himself; so what good he ever got at theUniversity, as to the matter of making his fortune, it's what I nevercould discover. However, I dare say he knows best; though when all comesto all, if I was to speak my mind, I think he's made but a poor hand ofit.ÓCecilia, who only through compassion to the blushing Henrietta forborerepressing this forwardness more seriously, merely answered Mrs Belfieldby wishing her good morning; but, while she was taking a kinder leave ofher timid daughter, the mother added ÒAs to the present, ma'am, you wasso kind to make us, Henny can witness for me every penny of it shall goto my son.ÓÒI rather meant it,Ó said Cecilia, Òfor your daughter; but if it is ofuse to any body, my purpose is sufficiently answered.ÓMrs Belfield again pressed her to sit down, but she would not againlisten to her, coldly saying ÒI am sorry you troubled Mr Belfield withany mention of what passed between his sister and me, but should youspeak of it again, I beg you will explain to him that he had no concernin that little transaction, which belonged wholly to ourselves.ÓShe then hastened down stairs, followed, however, by Mrs Belfield,making awkward excuses for what she had said, intermixed with frequenthints that she knew all the time she was in the right.This little incident, which convinced Cecilia Mrs Belfield was firmlypersuaded she was in love with her son, gave her much uneasiness; shefeared the son himself might entertain the same notion, and thoughtit most probable the daughter also had imbibed it, though but for theforward vulgarity of the sanguine mother, their opinions might long haveremained concealed. Her benevolence towards them, notwithstanding itspurity, must now therefore cease to be exerted; nor could she evenvisit Miss Belfield, since prudence, and a regard for her own character,seemed immediately to prohibit all commerce with the family.ÒAnd thus difficult,Ó cried she, Òis the blameless use of riches,though; all who want them, think nothing so easy as their disposal! Thisfamily I have so much wished to serve, I may at last only have injured,since the disappointment of their higher expectations, may render allsmaller benefits contemptible. And thus this unfortunate misconstructionof my good offices, robs them of a useful assistant, and deprives me atthe same time of an amiable companion.ÓAs soon as she returned home, she had a letter put into her hand whichcame from Mr Marriot, whose servant had twice called for an answer inthe short time she had been absent.This letter contained a most passionate avowal of the impression she hadmade on his heart the preceding evening, and an angry complaint that MrHarrel had refused to hear his proposals. He entreated her permission towait upon her for only five minutes, and concluded with the most ferventprofessions of respect and admiration.The precipitancy of this declaration served merely to confirm theopinion she had already conceived of the weakness of his understanding;but the obstinacy of Mr Harrel irritated and distressed her, thoughweary of expostulating with so hopeless a subject, whom neither reasonnor gratitude could turn from his own purposes, she was obliged tosubmit to his management, and was well content, in the present instance,to affirm his decree. She therefore wrote a concise answer to her newadmirer, in the usual form of civil rejection.CHAPTER iii. -- AN ACCOMMODATION.Cecilia was informed the next morning that a young woman begged to speakwith her, and upon sending for her up stairs, she saw, to her greatsurprise, Miss Belfield.She came in fear and trembling, sent, she said, by her mother, toentreat her pardon for what had passed the preceding day; ÒBut I know,madam,Ó she added, Òyou cannot pardon it, and therefore all that I meanto do is to clear my brother from any share in what was said, for indeedhe has too much sense to harbour any such presumption; and to thank youwith a most grateful heart for all the goodness you have shewn us.ÓAnd then, modestly courtsying, she would have returned home; butCecilia, much touched by her gentleness, took her hand, and kindlyreviving her by assurances of esteem, entreated that she would lengthenher stay.ÒHow good is this, madam,Ó said she, Òafter having so much reason tothink so ill of me and of all of us I tried all in my power to undeceivemy mother, or at least to keep her quiet; but she was so much persuadedshe was right, that she never would listen to me, and always said, did Isuppose it was for me you condescended to come so often?ÓÒYes,Ó answered Cecilia, Òmost undoubtedly; had I not known you, howeverwell I might have wished your brother, I should certainly not havevisited at his house. But I am very happy to hear the mistake had spreadno further.ÓÒNo indeed, madam, I never once thought of it; and as to my brother,when my mother only hinted it to him, he was quite angry. But thoughI don't mean to vindicate what has happened, you will not, I hope, bedispleased if I say my mother is much more pardonable than she seems tobe, for the same mistake she made with you, she would have been as aptto have made with a princess; it was not, therefore, from any want ofrespect, but merely from thinking my brother might marry as high as hepleased, and believing no lady would refuse him, if he would but havethe courage to speak.ÓCecilia assured her she would think no more of the error, but told herthat to avoid its renewal, she must decline calling upon her again tillher brother was gone. She begged therefore to see her in Portman-squarewhenever she had leisure, repeatedly assuring her of her good opinionand regard, and of the pleasure with which she should seize everyopportunity of shewing them.Delighted by a reception so kind, Miss Belfield remained with her allthe morning; and when at last she was obliged to leave her, she was buttoo happy in being solicited to repeat her visit.She suffered one day only to elapse before she shewed her readiness toaccept the friendship that was offered her; and Cecilia, much pleased bythis eagerness, redoubled her efforts to oblige and to serve her.From this time, hardly a day passed in which she did not call inPortman-square, where nothing in her reception was omitted that couldcontribute to her contentment. Cecilia was glad to employ her mind inany way that related not to Delvile, whom she now earnestly endeavouredto think of no more, denying herself even the pleasure of talking of himwith Miss Belfield, by the name of her brother's noble friend.During this time she devised various methods, all too delicate togive even the shadow of offence, for making both useful and ornamentalpresents to her new favourite, with whom she grew daily more satisfied,and to whom she purposed hereafter offering a residence in her ownhouse.The trial of intimacy, so difficult to the ablest to stand, and fromwhich even the most faultless are so rarely acquitted, Miss Belfieldsustained with honour. Cecilia found her artless, ingenuous, andaffectionate; her understanding was good, though no pains had been takento improve it; her disposition though ardent was soft, and her mindseemed informed by intuitive integrity.She communicated to Cecilia all the affairs of her family, disguisingfrom her neither distress nor meanness, and seeking to palliate nothingbut the grosser parts of the character of her mother. She seemed equallyready to make known to her even the most chosen secrets of her ownbosom, for that such she had was evident, from a frequent appearanceof absence and uneasiness which she took but little trouble to conceal.Cecilia, however, trusted not herself, in the present critical situationof her own mind, with any enquiries that might lead to a subject she wasconscious she ought not to dwell upon; a short time, she hoped, wouldtotally remove her suspence; but as she had much less reason to expectgood than evil, she made it her immediate study to prepare for theworst, and therefore carefully avoided all discourse that by nourishingher tenderness, might weaken her resolution.While thus, in friendly conversation and virtuous forbearance, passedgravely, but not unhappily, the time of Cecilia, the rest of the housewas very differently employed; feasting, revelling, amusements of allsorts were pursued with more eagerness than ever, and the alarm which solately threatened their destruction, seemed now merely to heightenthe avidity with which they were sought. Yet never was the disunion ofhappiness and diversion more striking and obvious; Mr Harrel, in spiteof his natural levity, was seized from time to time with fits of horrorthat embittered his gayest moments, and cast a cloud upon all hisenjoyments. Always an enemy to solitude, he now found it whollyinsupportable, and ran into company of any sort, less from a hope offinding entertainment, than from a dread of spending half an hour byhimself.Cecilia, who saw that his rapacity for pleasure encreased with hisuneasiness, once more ventured to speak with his lady upon the subjectof reformation; counselling her to take advantage of his presentapparent discontent, which showed at least some sensibility of hissituation, in order to point out to him the necessity of an immediateinspection into his affairs, which, with a total change in his way oflife, was her only chance for snatching him from the dismal despondencyinto which he was sinking.Mrs Harrel declared herself unequal to following this advice, and saidthat her whole study was to find Mr Harrel amusement, for he was grownso ill-humoured and petulant she quite feared being alone with him.The house therefore now was more crowded than ever, and nothing butdissipation was thought of. Among those who upon this plan were courtedto it, the foremost was Mr Morrice, who, from a peculiar talent ofuniting servility of conduct with gaiety of speech, made himself at onceso agreeable and useful in the family, that in a short time they fanciedit impossible to live without him. And Morrice, though his first view inobtaining admittance had been the cultivation of his acquaintance withCecilia, was perfectly satisfied with the turn that matters had taken,since his utmost vanity had never led him to entertain any matrimonialhopes with her, and he thought his fortune as likely to profit from thecivility of her friends as of herself. For Morrice, however flighty, andwild, had always at heart the study of his own interest; and though froma giddy forwardness of disposition he often gave offence, his meaningand his serious attention was not the less directed to the advancementof his own affairs; he formed no connection from which he hoped notsome benefit, and he considered the acquaintance and friendship of hissuperiors in no other light than that of procuring him sooner or laterrecommendations to new clients.Sir Robert Floyer also was more frequent than ever in his visits, andMr Harrel, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Cecilia, contrived everypossible opportunity of giving him access to her. Mrs Harrel herself,though hitherto neutral, now pleaded his cause with earnestness; and MrArnott, who had been her former refuge from this persecution, grew soserious and so tender in his devoirs, that unable any longer to doubtthe sentiments she had inspired, she was compelled even with him to beguarded and distant.She now with daily concern looked back to the sacrifice she had madeto the worthless and ungrateful Mr Harrel, and was sometimes tempted toimmediately chuse another guardian, and leave his house for ever;yet the delicacy of her disposition was averse to any step that mightpublicly expose him, and her early regard for his wife would not sufferher to put it in execution.These circumstances contributed strongly to encrease her intimacy withMiss Belfield; she now never saw Mrs Delvile, whom alone she preferredto her, and from the troublesome assiduity of Sir Robert, scarce evermet Mr Monckton but in his presence; she found, therefore, no resourceagainst teazing and vexation, but what was afforded her by theconversation of the amiable Henrietta.CHAPTER iv. -- A DETECTION.A fortnight had now elapsed in which Cecilia had had no sort ofcommunication with the Delviles, whom equally from pride and fromprudence she forbore to seek for herself, when one morning, while shewas sitting with Miss Belfield, her maid told her that young Mr Delvilewas in the drawing-room, and begged the honour of seeing her for a fewmoments.Cecilia, though she started and changed colour with surprize at thismessage, was unconscious she did either, from the yet greater surpriseshe received by the behaviour of Miss Belfield, who hastily arising,exclaimed ÒGood God, Mr Delvile!--do you know Mr Delvile, madam?--doesMr Delvile visit at this house?ÓÒSometimes; not often,Ó answered Cecilia; Òbut why?ÓÒI don't know,--nothing, madam,--I only asked by accident, Ibelieve,--but it's very--it's extremely--I did not knowÓ--and colouringviolently, she again sat down.An apprehension the most painful now took possession of Cecilia,and absorbed in thought, she continued for some minutes silent andimmoveable.From this state she was awakened by her maid, who asked if she chose tohave her gloves.Cecilia, taking them from her without speaking, left the room, and notdaring to stop for enquiry or consideration, hastened down stairs; butwhen she entered the apartment where young Delvile was waiting for her,all utterance seemed denied her, and she courtsied without saying aword.Struck with the look and uncommon manner of her entrance, he became ina moment as much disturbed as herself, pouring forth a thousandunnecessary and embarrassed apologies for his visit, and so totallyforgetting even the reason why he made it, that he had taken his leaveand was departing before he recollected it. He then turned back, forcinga laugh at his own absence of mind, and told her he had only called toacquaint her, that the commands with which she had honoured him were nowobeyed, and, he hoped, to her satisfaction.Cecilia, who knew not she had ever given him any, waited his furtherexplanation; and he then informed her he had that very morningintroduced Mr Belfield to the Earl of Vannelt, who had already heardhim very advantageously spoken of by some gentlemen to whom he had beenknown at the University, and who was so much pleased with him upon thisfirst interview, that he meant, after a few enquiries, which could notbut turn out to his credit, to commit his eldest son to his trust inmaking the tour of Europe.Cecilia thanked him for her share in the trouble he had taken in thistransaction; and then asked if Mrs Delvile continued well.ÒYes,Ó answered he, with a smile half reproachful, Òas well as one whohaving ever hoped your favour, can easily be after finding that hopedisappointed. But much as she has taught her son, there is one lessonshe might perhaps learn from him;--to fly, not seek, those dangerousindulgences of which the deprivation is the loss of peace!ÓHe then bowed, and made his exit.This unexpected reproof, and the yet more unexpected compliment thataccompanied it, in both which more seemed meant than met the ear,encreased the perturbation into which Cecilia had already been thrown.It occurred to her that under the sanction of his mother's name, he hadtaken an opportunity of making an apology for his own conduct; yetwhy avoiding her society, if to that he alluded, should be flying adangerous indulgence, she could not understand, since he had so littlereason to fear any repulse in continuing to seek it.Sorry, however, for the abrupt manner in which she had left MissBelfield, she lost not a moment in hastening back to her; but when shecame into the room, she found her employed in looking out of the window,her eye following some object with such earnestness of attention, thatshe perceived not her return.Cecilia, who could not doubt the motive of her curiosity, had no greatdifficulty in forbearing to offer her any interruption. She drew herhead back in a few minutes, and casting it upwards, with her handsclasped, softly whispered, ÒHeaven ever shield and bless him! and O mayhe never feel such pain as I do!ÓShe then again looked out, but soon drawing herself in, said, in thesame soft accents, ÒOh why art thou gone! sweetest and noblest of men!why might I not see thee longer, when, under heaven, there is no otherblessing I wish for!ÓA sigh which at these words escaped Cecilia made her start and turntowards the door; the deepest blushes overspread the cheeks of both astheir eyes met each other, and while Miss Belfield trembled in everylimb at the discovery she had made, Cecilia herself was hardly able tostand.A painful and most embarrassed silence succeeded, which was only brokenby Miss Belfield's bursting into tears.Cecilia, extremely moved, forgot for a moment her own interest in whatwas passing, and tenderly approaching, embraced her with the utmostkindness; but still she spoke not, fearing to make an enquiry, fromdreading to hear any explanation.Miss Belfield, soothed by her softness, clung about her, and hidingher face in her arms, sobbed out, ÒAh madam! who ought to be unhappyif befriended by you! if I could help it, I would love nobody else inalmost the whole world. But you must let me leave you now, and to-morrowI will tell you every thing.ÓCecilia, who had no wish for making any opposition, embraced her again,and suffered her quietly to depart.Her own mind was now in a state of the utmost confusion. The rectitudeof her heart and the soundness of her judgment had hitherto guarded herboth from error and blame, and, except during her recent suspence, hadpreserved her tranquility inviolate; but her commerce with the world hadbeen small and confined, and her actions had had little reference but toherself. The case was now altered; and she was suddenly in a conjunctureof all others the most delicate, that of accidentally discovering arival in a favourite friend.The fondness she had conceived for Miss Belfield, and the sincerity ofher intentions as well as promises to serve her, made the detection ofthis secret peculiarly cruel; she had lately felt no pleasure but in hersociety, and looked forward to much future comfort from the continuanceof her regard, and from their constantly living together; but now thiswas no longer even to be desired, since the utter annihilation of thewishes of both, by young Delvile's being disposed of to a third person,could alone render eligible their dwelling under the same roof.Her pity, however, for Miss Belfield was almost wholly unallayed byjealousy; she harboured not any suspicion that she was loved by youngDelvile, whose aspiring spirit led her infinitely more to fear somehigher rival, than to believe he bestowed even a thought upon the poorHenrietta; but still she wished with the utmost ardour to know thelength of their acquaintance, how often they had met, when they hadconversed, what notice he had taken of her, and how so dangerous apreference had invaded her heart.But though this curiosity was both natural and powerful, her principalconcern was the arrangement of her own conduct; the next day MissBelfield was to tell her every thing by a voluntary promise; but shedoubted if she had any right to accept such a confidence. Miss Belfield,she was sure, knew not she was interested in the tale, since she had noteven imagined that Delvile was known to her. She might hope, therefore,not only for advice but assistance, and fancy that while she reposed hersecret in the bosom of a friend, she secured herself her best officesand best wishes for ever.Would she obtain them? no; the most romantic generosity would revoltfrom such a demand, for however precarious was her own chance with youngDelvile, Miss Belfield she was sure could not have any; neither herbirth nor education fitted her for his rank in life, and even wereboth unexceptionable, the smallness of her fortune, as Mr Monckton hadinstructed her, would be an obstacle insurmountable.Would it not be a kind of treachery to gather from her every thing, yetaid her in nothing? to take advantage of her unsuspicious openness inorder to learn all that related to one whom she yet hoped would belongultimately to herself, and gratify an interested curiosity at theexpence of a candour not more simple than amiable? ÒNo,Ó cried Cecilia,Òarts that I could never forgive, I never will practice; this sweet, butunhappy girl shall tell me nothing; betrayed already by the tendernessof her own heart, she shall at least suffer no further from anyduplicity in mine. If, indeed, Mr Delvile, as I suspect, is engagedelsewhere, I will make this gentle Henrietta the object of my futuresolicitude; the sympathy of our situations will not then divide butunite us, and I will take her to my bosom, hear all her sorrows, andcalm her troubled spirit by participating in her sensibility. But if, onthe contrary, this mystery ends more happily for myself, if Mr Delvilehas now no other engagement, and hereafter clears his conduct to mysatisfaction, I will not be accessory to loading her future recollectionwith the shame of a confidence she then cannot but repent, nor with aninjury to her delicacy that may wound it for ever.ÓShe determined, therefore, carefully to avoid the subject for thepresent, since she could offer no advice for which she might not,hereafter, be suspected of selfish motives; but yet, from a real regardto the tender-hearted girl, to give all the tacit discouragement thatwas in her power, to a passion which she firmly believed would beproductive of nothing but misery.Once, from the frankness natural to her disposition, she thought notmerely of receiving but returning her confidence; her better judgment,however, soon led her from so hazardous a plan, which could only haveexposed them both to a romantic humiliation, by which, in the end, theirmutual expectations might prove sources of mutual distrust.When Miss Belfield, therefore, the next morning, her air unusuallytimid, and her whole face covered with blushes, made her visit, Cecilia,not seeming to notice her confusion, told her she was very sorry she wasobliged to go out herself, and contrived, under various pretences,to keep her maid in the room. Miss Belfield, supposing this to beaccidental, rejoiced in her imaginary reprieve, and soon recoveredher usual chearfulness; and Cecilia, who really meant to call upon MrsDelvile, borrowed Mrs Harrel's carriage, and set down her artless youngfriend at her new lodgings in Portland-street, before she proceededto St James's-square, talking the whole time upon matters of utterindifference.CHAPTER v. -- A SARCASM.The reproach which Cecilia had received from young Delvile in the nameof his mother, determined her upon making this visit; for though, in herpresent uncertainty, she wished only to see that family when sought bythemselves, she was yet desirous to avoid all appearance of singularity,lest any suspicions should be raised of her sentiments.Mrs Delvile received her with a cold civility that chilled and afflictedher; she found her seriously offended by her long absence, and now forthe first time perceived that haughtiness of character which hithertoshe had thought only given to her by the calumny of envy; for thoughher displeasure was undisguised, she deigned not to make any reproaches,evidently shewing that her disappointment in the loss of her society,was embittered by a proud regret for the kindness she believed she hadthrown away. But though she scrupulously forbore the smallest complaint,she failed not from time to time to cast out reflections upon ficklenessand caprice the most satirical and pointed.Cecilia, who could not possibly avow the motives of her behaviour,ventured not to offer any apology for her apparent negligence; but,hitherto accustomed to the most distinguished kindness, a change to somuch bitterness shocked and overpowered her, and she sat almost whollysilent, and hardly able to look up.Lady Honoria Pemberton, a daughter of the Duke of Derwent, now cameinto the room, and afforded her some relief by the sprightliness of herconversation. This young lady, who was a relation of the Delviles, andof a character the most airy and unthinking, ran on during her wholevisit in a vein of fashionable scandal, with a levity that the censuresof Mrs Delvile, though by no means spared, had no power to [controul];and, after having completely ransacked the topics of the day, she turnedsuddenly to Cecilia, with whom during her residence in St James's-squareshe had made some acquaintance, and said, ÒSo I hear, Miss Beverley,that after half the town has given you to Sir Robert Floyer, and theother half to my Lord Derford, you intend, without regarding one side orthe other, to disappoint them both, and give yourself to Mr Marriot.ÓÒMe? no, indeed,Ó answered Cecilia, Òyour ladyship has been muchmisinformed.ÓÒI hope so,Ó said Mrs Delvile, Òfor Mr Marriot, by all I ever heardof him, seems to have but one recommendation, and that the last MissBeverley ought to value, a good estate.ÓCecilia, secretly delighted by a speech which she could not resistflattering herself had reference to her son, now a little revived, andendeavoured to bear some part in the conversation.ÒEverybody one meets,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òdisposes of Miss Beverley tosome new person; yet the common opinion is that Sir Robert Floyer willbe the man. But upon my word, for my own part, I cannot conjecture howshe will manage among them, for Mr Marriot declares he's determined hewon't be refused, and Sir Robert vows that he'll never give her up. Sowe none of us know how it will end; but I am vastly glad she keeps themso long in suspence.ÓÒIf there is any suspence,Ó said Cecilia, ÒI am at least sure it must bewilful. But why should your ladyship rejoice in it?ÓÒO, because it helps to torment them, and keeps something going forward.Besides, we are all looking in the news-papers every day, to see whenthey'll fight another duel for you.ÓÒAnother?Ó cried Cecilia; Òindeed they have never yet fought any forme.ÓÒO, I beg your pardon,Ó answered her ladyship, ÒSir Robert, you know,fought one for you in the beginning of the winter, with that Irishfortune-hunter who affronted you at the Opera.ÓÒIrish fortune-hunter?Ó repeated Cecilia, Òhow strangely has thatquarrel been misrepresented! In the first place, I never was affrontedat the Opera at all, and in the second, if your Ladyship means MrBelfield, I question if he ever was in Ireland in his life.ÓÒWell,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òhe might come from Scotland, for aughtI know, but somewhere he certainly came from; and they tell me he iswounded terribly, and Sir Robert has had all his things packed up thismonth, that in case he should die, he may go abroad in a moment.ÓÒAnd pray where, Lady Honoria,Ó cried Mrs Delvile, Òdo you contrive topick up all this rattle?ÓÒO, I don't know; everybody tells me something, so I put it all togetheras well as I can. But I could acquaint you with a stranger piece of newsthan any you have heard yet.ÓÒAnd what is that?ÓÒO, if I let you know it, you'll tell your son.ÓÒNo indeed,Ó said Mrs Delvile laughing, ÒI shall probably forget itmyself.ÓShe then made some further difficulty, and Cecilia, uncertain if she wasmeant to be a party in the communication, strolled to a window; where,however, as Lady Honoria did not lower her voice, she heard her say ÒWhyyou must know I am told he keeps a mistress somewhere in Oxford-Road.They say she's mighty pretty; I should like vastly to see her.ÓThe consternation of Cecilia at this intelligence would certainlyhave betrayed all she so much wished to conceal, had not her fortunateremoval to the window guarded her from observation. She kept her post,fearing to look round, but was much pleased when Mrs Delvile, withgreat indignation answered ÒI am sorry, Lady Honoria, you can find anyamusement in listening to such idle scandal, which those who tell willnever respect you for hearing. In times less daring in slander, thecharacter of Mortimer would have proved to him a shield from allinjurious aspersions; yet who shall wonder he could not escape, andwho shall contemn the inventors of calumny, if Lady Honoria Pembertoncondescends to be entertained with it?ÓÒDear Mrs Delvile,Ó cried Lady Honoria, giddily, Òyou take me tooseriously.ÓÒAnd dear Lady Honoria,Ó said Mrs Delvile, ÒI would it were possible tomake you take yourself seriously; for could you once see with clearnessand precision how much you lower your own dignity, while you stoopto depreciate that of others, the very subjects that now make yourdiversion, would then, far more properly, move your resentment.ÓÒAy but, dear madam,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òif that were the case, Ishould be quite perfect, and then you and I should never quarrel, and Idon't know what we should do for conversation.ÓAnd with these words, hastily shaking hands with her, she took leave.ÒSuch conversation,Ó said Mrs Delvile when she was gone, Òas resultsfrom the mixture of fruitless admonition with incorrigible levity, wouldbe indeed more honoured in the breach than the observance. But levityis so much the fashionable characteristic of the present age, that a gayyoung girl who, like Lady Honoria Pemberton, rules the friends by whomshe ought to be ruled, had little chance of escaping it.ÓÒShe seems so open, however, to reproof,Ó said Cecilia, Òthat I shouldhope in a short time she may also be open to conviction.ÓÒNo,Ó answered Mrs Delvile, ÒI have no hope of her at all. I once tookmuch pains with her; but I soon found that the easiness with which shehears of her faults, is only another effect of the levity with whichshe commits them. But if the young are never tired of erring in conduct,neither are the older in erring in judgment; the fallibility of mine Ihave indeed very lately experienced.ÓCecilia, who strongly felt the poignancy of this sarcasm, and whoseconstant and unaffected value of Mrs Delvile by no means deserved it,was again silenced, and again most cruelly depressed; nor could shesecretly forbear repining that at the very moment she found herselfthreatened with a necessity of foregoing the society of her newfavourite, Miss Belfield, the woman in the whole world whom she mostwished to have for her friend, from an unhappy mistake was ready torelinquish her. Grieved to be thus fallen in her esteem, and shockedthat she could offer no justification, after a short and thoughtfulpause, she gravely arose to take leave.Mrs Delvile then told her that if she had any business to transact withMr Delvile, she advised her to acquaint him with it soon, as the wholefamily left town in a few days.This was a new and severe blow to Cecilia, who sorrowfully repeated ÒIna few days, madam?ÓÒYes,Ó answered Mrs Delvile, ÒI hope you intend to be much concerned?ÓÒAh madam!Ó cried Cecilia, who could no longer preserve her quietness,Òif you knew but half the respect I bear you, but half the sinceritywith which I value and revere you, all protestations would be useless,for all accusations would be over!ÓMrs Delvile, at once surprised and softened by the warmth of thisdeclaration, instantly took her hand, and said ÒThey shall now, and forever be over, if it pains you to hear them. I concluded that what I saidwould be a matter of indifference to you, or all my displeasure wouldimmediately have been satisfied, when once I had intimated that yourabsence had excited it.ÓÒThat I have excited it at all,Ó answered Cecilia, Ògives me indeedthe severest uneasiness; but believe me, madam, however unfortunatelyappearances maybe against me, I have always had the highest sense of thekindness with which you have honoured me, and never has there been thesmallest abatement in the veneration, gratitude, and affection I haveinviolably borne you.ÓÒYou see, then,Ó said Mrs Delvile with a smile, Òthat where reprooftakes any effect, it is not received; with that easiness you were justnow admiring; on the contrary, where a concession is made withoutpain, it is also made without meaning, for it is not in human nature toproject any amendment without a secret repugnance. That here, however,you should differ from Lady Honoria Pemberton, who can wonder, when youare superior to all comparison with her in every thing?ÓÒWill you then,Ó said Cecilia, Òaccept my apology, and forgive me?ÓÒI will do more,Ó said Mrs Delvile laughing, ÒI will forgive you withoutan apology; for the truth is I have heard none! But come,Ó continuedshe, perceiving Cecilia much abashed by this comment, ÒI will enquire nomore about the matter; I am glad to receive my young friend again, andeven half ashamed, deserving as she is, to say how glad!ÓShe then embraced her affectionately, and owned she had been moremortified by her fancied desertion than she had been willing to own evento herself, repeatedly assuring her that for many years she had notmade any acquaintance she so much wished to cultivate, nor enjoyed anysociety from which she had derived so much pleasure.Cecilia, whose eyes glistened with modest joy, while her heart beatquick with revived expectation, in listening to an effusion of praiseso infinitely grateful to her, found little difficulty in returning herfriendly professions, and, in a few minutes, was not merely reconciled,but more firmly united with her than ever.Mrs Delvile insisted upon keeping her to dinner, and Cecilia, but toohappy in her earnestness, readily agreed to send Mrs Harrel an excuse.Neither of the Mr Delviles spent the day at home, and nothing,therefore, disturbed or interrupted those glowing and delightfulsensations which spring from a cordial renewal of friendship andkindness. The report, indeed, of Lady Honoria Pemberton gave her someuneasiness, yet the flighty character of that lady, and Mrs Delvile'sreply to it, soon made her drive it from her mind.She returned home early in the evening, as other company was expected,and she had not changed her dress since the morning; but she first madea promise to see Mrs Delvile some part of every day during the shorttime that she meant to remain in town.CHAPTER vi. -- A SURMISE.The next morning opened with another scene; Mrs Harrel ran intoCecilia's room before breakfast, and acquainted her that Mr Harrel hadnot been at home all night.The consternation with which she heard this account she instantlyendeavoured to dissipate, in order to soften the apprehension with whichit was communicated; Mrs Harrel, however, was extremely uneasy, andsent all the town over to make enquiries, but without receiving anyintelligence.Cecilia, unwilling to leave her in a state of such alarm, wrote anexcuse to Mrs Delvile, that she might continue with her till someinformation was procured. A subject also of such immediate concern, wassufficient apology for avoiding any particular conversation with MissBelfield, who called, as usual, about noon, and whose susceptible heartwas much affected by the evident disturbance in which she found Cecilia.The whole day passed, and no news arrived; but, greatly to herastonishment, Mrs Harrel in the evening prepared for going to anassembly! yet declaring at the same time it was extremely disagreeableto her, only she was afraid, if she stayed away, every body wouldsuppose something was the matter.Who then at last, thought Cecilia, are half so much the slaves of theworld as the gay and the dissipated? Those who work for hire, haveat least their hours of rest, those who labour for subsistence are atliberty when subsistence is procured; but those who toil to please thevain and the idle, undertake a task which can never be finished,however scrupulously all private peace, and all internal comfort, may besacrificed in reality to the folly of saving appearances!Losing, however, the motive for which she had given up her ownengagement, she now sent for her chair, in order to spend an hour or twowith Mrs Delvile. The servants, as they conducted her up stairs, saidthey would call their lady; and in entering the drawing-room she saw,reading and alone, young Delvile.He seemed much surprised, but received her with the utmost respect,apologizing for the absence of his mother, whom he said had understoodshe was not to see her till the next day, and had left him to writeletters now, that she might then be at liberty.Cecilia in return made excuses for her seeming inconsistency; afterwhich, for some time, all conversation dropt.The silence was at length broken by young Delvile's saying ÒMrBelfield's merit has not been thrown away upon Lord Vannelt; he hasheard an excellent character of him from all his former acquaintance,and is now fitting up an apartment for him in his own house till his sonbegins his tour.ÓCecilia said she was very happy in hearing such intelligence; and thenagain they were both silent.ÒYou have seen,Ó said young Delvile, after this second pause, ÒMrBelfield's sister?ÓCecilia, not without changing colour, answered ÒYes, Sir.ÓÒShe is very amiable,Ó he continued, Òtoo amiable, indeed, for hersituation, since her relations, her brother alone excepted, are allutterly unworthy of her.ÓHe stopt; but Cecilia made no answer, and he presently added ÒPerhapsyou do not think her amiable?--you may have seen more of her, and knowsomething to her disadvantage?ÓÒO no!Ó cried Cecilia, with a forced alacrity, Òbut only I was thinkingthat--did you say you knew all her relations?ÓÒNo,Ó he answered, Òbut when I have been with Mr Belfield, some of themhave called upon him.ÓAgain they were both silent; and then Cecilia, ashamed of her apparentbackwardness to give praise, compelled herself to say, ÒMiss Belfieldis indeed a very sweet girl, and I wish--Ó she stopt, not well knowingherself what she meant to add.ÒI have been greatly pleased,Ó said he, after waiting some time to hearif she would finish her speech, Òby being informed of your goodness toher, and I think she seems equally to require and to deserve it. I doubtnot you will extend it to her when she is deprived of her brother, forthen will be the time that by doing her most service, it will reflect onyourself most honour.ÓCecilia, confounded by this recommendation, faintly answeredÒCertainly,--whatever is in my power,--I shall be very glad--ÓAnd just then Mrs Delvile made her appearance, and during the mutualapologies that followed, her son left the room. Cecilia, glad of anypretence to leave it also, insisted upon giving no interruption to MrsDelvile's letter writing, and having promised to spend all the next daywith her, hurried back to her chair.The reflections that followed her thither were by no means the mostsoothing; she began now to apprehend that the pity she had bestowed uponMiss Belfield, Miss Belfield in a short time might bestow upon her; atany other time, his recommendation would merely have served to confirmher opinion of his benevolence, but in her present state of anxietyand uncertainty, every thing gave birth to conjecture, and had power toalarm her. He had behaved to her of late with the strangest coldnessand distance,--his praise of Henrietta had been ready andanimated,--Henrietta she knew adored him, and she knew not with whatreason,--but an involuntary suspicion arose in her mind, that thepartiality she had herself once excited, was now transferred to thatlittle dreaded, but not less dangerous rival.Yet, if such was the case, what was to become either of the pride orthe interest of his family? Would his relations ever pardon an alliancestimulated neither by rank nor riches? would Mr Delvile, who hardlyever spoke but to the high-born, without seeming to think his dignitysomewhat injured, deign to receive for a daughter-in-law the child of acitizen and tradesman? would Mrs Delvile herself, little less elevatedin her notions, though infinitely softer in her manners, ever condescendto acknowledge her? Cecilia's own birth and connections, superior asthey were to those of Miss Belfield, were even openly disdained by MrDelvile, and all her expectations of being received into his familywere founded upon the largeness of her fortune, in favour of which thebrevity of her genealogy might perhaps pass unnoticed. But what was thechance of Miss Belfield, who neither had ancestors to boast, nor wealthto allure?This thought, however, awakened all the generosity of her soul; ÒIf,Ó cried she, Òthe advantages I possess are merely those of riches, howlittle should I be flattered by any appearance of preference! and howill can I judge with what sincerity it may be offered! happier in thatcase is the lowly Henrietta, who to poverty may attribute neglect, butwho can only be sought and caressed from motives of purest regard. Sheloves Mr Delvile, loves him with the most artless affection;--perhaps,too, he loves her in return,--why else his solicitude to know my opinionof her, and why so sudden his alarm when he thought it unfavourable?Perhaps he means to marry her, and to sacrifice to her innocence andher attractions all plans of ambition, and all views ofaggrandizement;--thrice happy Henrietta, if such is thy prospect offelicity! to have inspired a passion so disinterested, may humble themost insolent of thy superiors, and teach even the wealthiest to envythee!ÓCHAPTER vii. -- A BOLD STROKE.When Cecilia returned home, she heard with much concern that no tidingsof Mr Harrel had yet been obtained. His lady, who did not stay out late,was now very seriously frightened, and entreated Cecilia to sit up withher till some news could be procured; she sent also for her brother, andthey all three, in trembling expectation of what was to ensue, passedthe whole night in watching.At six o'clock in the morning, Mr Arnott besought his sister and Ceciliato take some rest, promising to go out himself to every place whereMr Harrel was known to resort, and not to return without bringing someaccount of him.Mrs Harrel, whose feelings were not very acute, finding the persuasionsof her brother were seconded by her own fatigue, consented to follow hisadvice, and desired him to begin his search immediately.A few moments after he was gone, while Mrs Harrel and Cecilia wereupon the stairs, they were startled by a violent knocking at the door;Cecilia, prepared for some calamity, hurried her friend back to thedrawing-room, and then flying out of it again to enquire who entered,saw to her equal surprize and relief, Mr Harrel himself.She ran back with the welcome information, and he instantly followedher; Mrs Harrel eagerly told him of her fright, and Cecilia expressedher pleasure at his return; but the satisfaction of neither was of longduration.He came into the room with a look of fierceness the most terrifying, hishat on, and his arms folded. He made no answer to what they said, butpushed back the door with his foot, and flung himself upon a sofa.Cecilia would now have withdrawn, but Mrs Harrel caught her hand toprevent her. They continued some minutes in this situation, and then MrHarrel, suddenly rising, called-out ÒHave you any thing to pack up?ÓÒPack up?Ó repeated Mrs Harrel, ÒLord bless me, for what?ÓÒI am going abroad,Ó he answered; ÒI shall set off to-morrow.ÓÒAbroad?Ó cried she, bursting into tears, ÒI am sure I hope not!ÓÒHope nothing!Ó returned he, in a voice of rage; and then, with adreadful oath, he ordered her to leave him and pack up.Mrs Harrel, wholly unused to such treatment, was frightened into violenthysterics; of which, however, he took no notice, but swearing at her fora fool who had been the cause of his ruin, he left the room.Cecilia, though she instantly rang the bell, and hastened to herassistance, was so much shocked by this unexpected brutality, that shescarcely knew how to act, or what to order. Mrs Harrel, however, soonrecovered, and Cecilia accompanied her to her own apartment, where shestayed, and endeavoured to sooth her till Mr Arnott returned.The terrible state in which Mr Harrel had at last come home wasimmediately communicated to him, and his sister entreated him to useall his influence that the scheme for going abroad might be deferred, atleast, if not wholly given up.Fearfully he went on the embassy, but speedily, and with a lookwholly dismayed, he returned. Mr Harrel, he said, told him that he hadcontracted a larger debt of honour than he had any means to raise, andas he could not appear till it was paid, he was obliged to quit thekingdom without delay.ÒOh brother!Ó cried Mrs Harrel, Òand can you suffer us to go?ÓÒAlas, my dear sister,Ó answered he, Òwhat can I do to prevent it? andwho, if I too am ruined, will in future help you?ÓMrs Harrel then wept bitterly, nor could the gentle Mr Arnott, forbear,while he tried to comfort her, mixing his own tears with those ofhis beloved sister; but Cecilia, whose reason was stronger, and whosejustice was offended, felt other sensations; and leaving Mrs Harrel tothe care of her brother, whose tenderness she infinitely compassionated,she retreated into her own room. Not, however, to rest; the dreadfulsituation of the family made her forget she wanted it, but to deliberateupon what course she ought herself to pursue.She determined without any hesitation against accompanying them in theirflight, as the irreparable injury she was convinced she had already doneher fortune, was more than sufficient to satisfy the most romanticideas of friendship and humanity; but her own place of abode must nowimmediately be changed, and her choice rested only between Mr Delvileand Mr Briggs.Important as were the obstacles which opposed her residence at MrDelvile's, all that belonged to inclination and to happiness encouragedit; while with respect to Mr Briggs, though the objections were lighter,there was not a single allurement. Yet whenever the suspicion recurredto her that Miss Belfield was beloved by young Delvile, she resolvedat all events to avoid him; but when better hopes intervened, andrepresented that his enquiries were probably accidental, the wish ofbeing finally acquainted with his sentiments, made nothing so desirableas an intercourse more frequent.Such still was her irresolution, when she received a message from MrArnott to entreat the honour of seeing her. She immediately went downstairs, and found him in the utmost distress, ÒO Miss Beverley,Ó hecried, Òwhat can I do for my sister! what can I possibly devise torelieve her affliction!ÓÒIndeed I know not!Ó said Cecilia, Òbut the utter impracticability ofpreparing her for this blow, obviously as it has long been impending,makes it now fall so heavily I wish much to assist her,--but a debt sounjustifiably contracted--ÓÒO madam,Ó interrupted he, Òimagine not I sent to you with sotreacherous a view as to involve you in our misery; far too unworthilyhas your generosity already been abused. I only wish to consult with youwhat I can do for my sister.ÓCecilia, after some little consideration, proposed that Mrs Harrelshould still be left in England, and under their joint care.ÒAlas!Ó cried he, ÒI have already made that proposal, but Mr Harrel willnot go without her, though his whole behaviour is so totally altered,that I fear to trust her with him.ÓÒWho is there, then, that has more weight with him?Ó said Cecilia,Òshall we send for Sir Robert Floyer to second our request?ÓTo this Mr Arnott assented, forgetting in his apprehension of losing hissister, the pain he should suffer from the interference of his rival.The Baronet presently arrived, and Cecilia, not chusing to apply to himherself, left him with Mr Arnott, and waited for intelligence in thelibrary.In about an hour after, Mrs Harrel ran into the room, her tears driedup, and out of breath with joy, and called out ÒMy dearest friend, myfate is now all in your hands, and I am sure you will not refuse to makeme happy.ÓÒWhat is it I can do for you?Ó cried Cecilia, dreading someimpracticable proposal; Òask me not, I beseech you, what I cannotperform!ÓÒNo, no,Ó answered she, ÒWhat I ask requires nothing but good nature;Sir Robert Floyer has been begging Mr Harrel to leave me behind, and hehas promised to comply, upon condition you will hasten your marriage,and take me into your own house.ÓÒMy marriage!Ó cried the astonished Cecilia.Here they were joined by Mr Harrel himself, who repeated the same offer.ÒYou both amaze and shock me!Ó cried Cecilia, Òwhat is it you mean, andwhy do you talk to me so wildly?ÓÒMiss Beverley,Ó cried Mr Harrel, Òit is high time now to give up thisreserve, and trifle no longer with a gentleman so unexceptionable as SirRobert Floyer. The whole town has long acknowledged him as your husband,and you are every where regarded as his bride, a little frankness,therefore, in accepting him, will not only bind him to you for ever, butdo credit to the generosity of your character.ÓAt that moment Sir Robert himself burst into the room, and seizing oneof her hands, while both of them were uplifted in mute amazement, hepressed it to his lips, poured forth a volley of such compliments ashe had never before prevailed with himself to utter, and confidentlyentreated her to complete his long-attended happiness without thecruelty of further delay.Cecilia, almost petrified by the excess of her surprise, at an attack soviolent, so bold, and apparently so sanguine, was for some time scarceable to speak or to defend herself; but when Sir Robert, presuming onher silence, said she had made him the happiest of men, she indignantlydrew back her hand, and with a look of displeasure that required littleexplanation, would have walked out of the room; when Mr Harrel, in atone of bitterness and disappointment, called out ÒIs this lady-liketyranny then never to end?Ó And Sir Robert, impatiently following her,said ÒAnd is my suspense to endure for ever? After so many months'attendance--ÓÒThis, indeed, is something too much,Ó said Cecilia, turning back, ÒYouhave been kept, Sir, in no suspense; the whole tenor of my conduct hasuniformly declared the same disapprobation I at present avow, and whichmy letter, at least, must have put beyond all doubt.ÓÒHarrel,Ó exclaimed Sir Robert, Òdid not you tell me--ÓÒPho, Pho,Ó cried Harrel, Òwhat signifies calling upon me? I never sawin Miss Beverley any disapprobation beyond what it is customary foryoung ladies of a sentimental turn to shew; and every body knows thatwhere a gentleman is allowed to pay his devoirs for any length of time,no lady intends to use him very severely.ÓÒAnd can you, Mr Harrel,Ó said Cecilia, Òafter such conversations ashave passed between us, persevere in this wilful misapprehension? Butit is vain to debate where all reasoning is disregarded, or to make anyprotestations where even rejection is received as a favour.ÓAnd then, with an air of disdain, she insisted upon passing them, andwent to her own room.Mrs Harrel, however, still followed, and clinging round her, stillsupplicated her pity and compliance.ÒWhat infatuation is this!Ó cried Cecilia, Òis it possible that you,too, can suppose I ever mean to accept Sir Robert?ÓÒTo be sure I do,Ó answered she, Òfor Mr Harrel has told me a thousandtimes, that however you played the prude, you would be his at last.ÓCecilia, though doubly irritated against Mr Harrel, was now appeasedwith his lady, whose mistake, however ill-founded, offered an excusefor her behaviour; but she assured her in the strongest terms that herrepugnance to the Baronet was unalterable, yet told her she might claimfrom her every good office that was not wholly unreasonable.These were words of slender comfort to Mrs Harrel, who well knew thather wishes and reason had but little affinity, and she soon, therefore,left the room.Cecilia then resolved to go instantly to Mrs Delvile, acquaint her withthe necessity of her removal, and make her decision whither, accordingto the manner in which her intelligence should be received.She sent, therefore, to order a chair, and was already in the hall, whenshe was stopt by the entrance of Mr Monckton, who, addressing her witha look of haste and earnestness, said, ÒI will not ask whither you aregoing so early, or upon what errand, for I must beg a moment's audience,be your business what it may.ÓCecilia then accompanied him to the deserted breakfast room, which nonebut the servants had this morning entered, and there, grasping her hand,he said, ÒMiss Beverley, you must fly this house directly! it is theregion of disorder and licentiousness, and unfit to contain you.ÓShe assured him she was that moment preparing to quit it, but begged hewould explain himself.ÒI have taken care,Ó he answered, Òfor some time past, to be wellinformed of all the proceedings of Mr Harrel; and the intelligence Iprocured this morning is of the most alarming nature. I find he spentthe night before the last entirely at a gaming table, where, intoxicatedby a run of good luck, he passed the whole of the next day in riotingwith his profligate intimates, and last night, returning again to hisfavourite amusement, he not only lost all he had gained, but much morethan he could pay. Doubt not, therefore, but you will be called upon toassist him; he still considers you as his resource in times of danger,and while he knows you are under his roof, he will always believehimself secure.ÓÒEvery thing indeed conspires,Ó said Cecilia, more shocked thansurprised at this account, Òto make it necessary I should quit hishouse; yet I do not think he has at present any further expectationsfrom me, as he came into the room this morning not merely withoutspeaking to me, but behaved with a brutality to Mrs Harrel that he mustbe certain would give me disgust. It shewed me, indeed, a new part ofhis character, for ill as I have long thought of him, I did not suspecthe could be guilty of such unmanly cruelty.ÓÒThe character of a gamester,Ó said Mr Monckton, Òdepends solely uponhis luck; his disposition varies with every throw of the dice, and heis airy, gay and good humoured, or sour, morose and savage, neither fromnature nor from principle, but wholly by the caprice of chance.ÓCecilia then related to him the scene in which she had just been engagedwith Sir Robert Floyer.ÒThis,Ó cried he, Òis a manoeuvre I have been some time expecting; butMr Harrel, though artful and selfish, is by no means deep. The planhe had formed would have succeeded with some women, and he thereforeconcluded it would with all. So many of your sex have been subduedby perseverance, and so many have been conquered by boldness, that hesupposed when he united two such powerful besiegers in the person ofa Baronet, he should vanquish all obstacles. By assuring you that theworld thought the marriage already settled, he hoped to surprise youinto believing there was no help for it, and by the suddenness andvehemence of the attack, to frighten and hurry you into compliance.His own wife, he knew, might have been managed thus with ease, and so,probably, might his sister, and his mother, and his cousin, for in lovematters, or what are so called, women in general are, readily duped. Hediscerned not the superiority of your understanding to tricks so shallowand impertinent, nor the firmness of your mind in maintaining its ownindependence. No doubt but he was amply to have been rewarded for hisassistance, and probably had you this morning been propitious, theBaronet in return was to have cleared him from his present difficulty.ÓÒEven in my own mind,Ó said Cecilia, ÒI can no longer defend him, for hecould never have been so eager to promote the interest of Sir Robert,in the present terrible situation of his own affairs, had he not beenstimulated by some secret motives. His schemes and his artifices,however, will now be utterly lost upon me, since your warning andadvice, aided by my own suffering experience of the inutility of all Ican do for him, will effectually guard me from all his future attempts.ÓÒRest no security upon yourself,Ó said Mr Monckton, Òsince you haveno knowledge of the many tricks and inventions by which you may yetbe plundered. Perhaps he may beg permission to reside in your house inSuffolk, or desire an annuity for his wife, or chuse to receive yourfirst rents when you come of age; and whatever he may fix upon, hisdagger and his bowl will not fail to procure him. A heart so liberal asyours can only be guarded by flight. You were going, you said, when Icame,--and whither?ÓÒTo--to St James's-square,Ó answered she, with a deep blush.ÒIndeed!--is young Delvile, then, going abroad?ÓÒAbroad?--no,--I believe not.ÓÒNay, I only imagined it from your chusing to reside in his house.ÓÒI do not chuse it,Ó cried Cecilia, with quickness, Òbut is not anything preferable to dwelling with Mr Briggs?ÓÒCertainly,Ó said Mr Monckton coolly, Ònor should I have supposed he hadany chance with you, had I not hitherto observed that your conveniencehas always been sacrificed to your sense of propriety.ÓCecilia, touched by praise so full of censure, and earnest to vindicateher delicacy, after an internal struggle, which Mr Monckton was toosubtle to interrupt, protested she would go instantly to Mr Briggs, andsee if it were possible to be settled in his house, before she made anyattempt to fix herself elsewhere.ÒAnd when?Ó said Mr Monckton.ÒI don't know,Ó answered she, with some hesitation, Òperhaps thisafternoon.ÓÒWhy not this morning?ÓÒI can go out no where this morning; I must stay with Mrs Harrel.ÓÒYou thought otherwise when I came, you were then content to leave her.ÓCecilia's alacrity, however, for changing her abode, was now at an end,and she would fain have been left quietly to re-consider her plans; butMr Monckton urged so strongly the danger of her lengthened stay in thehouse of so designing a man as Mr Harrel, that he prevailed with her toquit it without delay, and had himself the satisfaction of handing herto her chair.CHAPTER viii. -- A MISER'S MANSION.Mr Briggs was at home, and Cecilia instantly and briefly informed himthat it was inconvenient for her to live any longer at Mr Harrel's, andthat if she could be accommodated at his house, she should be glad toreside with him during the rest of her minority.ÒShall, shall,Ó cried he, extremely pleased, Òtake you with all myheart. Warrant Master Harrel's made a good penny of you. Not a bit thebetter for dressing so fine; many a rogue in a gold lace hat.ÓCecilia begged to know what apartments he could spare for her.ÒTake you up stairs,Ó cried he, Òshew you a place for a queen.ÓHe then led her up stairs, and took her to a room entirely dark, and soclose for want of air that she could hardly breathe in it. She retreatedto the landing-place till he had opened the shutters, and then saw anapartment the most forlorn she had ever beheld, containing no otherfurniture than a ragged stuff bed, two worn-out rush-bottomed chairs, anold wooden box, and a bit of broken glass which was fastened to the wallby two bent nails.ÒSee here, my little chick,Ó cried he, Òeverything ready! and a box foryour gimcracks into the bargain.ÓÒYou don't mean this place for me, Sir!Ó cried Cecilia, staring.ÒDo, do;Ó cried he, Òa deal nicer by and by. Only wants a littlefurbishing; soon put to rights. Never sweep a room out of use; onlywears out brooms for nothing.ÓÒBut, Sir, can I not have an apartment on the first floor?ÓÒNo, no, something else to do with it; belongs to the club; secrets inall things! Make this do well enough. Come again next week; wear quite anew face. Nothing wanting but a table; pick you up one at a broker's.ÓÒBut I am obliged, Sir, to leave Mr Harrel's house directly.ÓÒWell, well, make shift without a table at first; no great matter ifyou ha'n't one at all, nothing particular to do with it. Want anotherblanket, though. Know where to get one; a very good broker hard by.Understand how to deal with him! A close dog, but warm.ÓÒI have also two servants, Sir,Ó said Cecilia.ÒWon't have 'em! Sha'n't come! Eat me out of house and home.ÓÒWhatever they eat, Sir,Ó answered she, Òwill be wholly at my expence,as will everything else that belongs to them.ÓÒBetter get rid of them; hate servants; all a pack of rogues; think ofnothing but stuffing and guzzling.ÓThen opening another door, ÒSee here,Ó he cried, Òmy own room just by;snug as a church!ÓCecilia, following him into it, lost a great part of her surprise atthe praise he had lavished upon that which he destined for herself, byperceiving that his own was yet more scantily furnished, having nothingin it but a miserable bed without any curtains, and a large chest,which, while it contained his clothes, sufficed both for table andchair.ÒWhat are doing here?Ó cried he angrily, to a maid who was making thebed, Òcan't you take more care? beat 'out all the feathers, see! two onthe ground; nothing but waste and extravagance! never mind how soon aman's ruined. Come to want, you slut, see that, come to want!ÓÒI can never want more than I do here,Ó said the girl, Òso that's onecomfort.ÓCecilia now began to repent she had made known the purport of her visit,for she found it would be utterly impossible to accommodate either hermind or her person to a residence such as was here to be obtained andshe only wished Mr Monckton had been present, that he might himself beconvinced of the impracticability of his scheme. Her whole business,therefore, now, was to retract her offer, and escape from the house.ÒI see, Sir,Ó said she, when he turned from his servant, Òthat I cannotbe received here without inconvenience, and therefore I will make somenew arrangement in my plan.ÓÒNo, no,Ó cried he, Òlike to have you, 'tis but fair, all in our turn;won't be chorused; Master Harrel's had his share. Sorry could not getyou that sweetheart! would not bite; soon find out another; never fret.ÓÒBut there are so many things with which I cannot possibly dispense,Ó said Cecilia, Òthat I am certain my removing hither would occasion youfar more trouble than you at present foresee.ÓÒNo, no; get all in order soon; go about myself; know how to bid;understand trap; always go shabby; no making a bargain in a good coat.Look sharp at the goods; say they won't do; come away; send somebodyelse for 'em. Never go twice myself; nothing got cheap if one seems tohave a hankering.ÓÒBut I am sure it is not possible,Ó said Cecilia, hurrying down stairs,Òthat my room, and one for each of my servants, should be ready intime.ÓÒYes, yes,Ó cried he, following her, Òready in a trice. Make a littleshift at first; double the blanket till we get another; lie with themaid a night or two; never stand for a trifle.ÓAnd, when she was seated in her chair, the whole time disclaiming herintention of returning, he only pinched her cheek with a facetioussmirk, and said, ÒBy, by, little duck; come again soon. Warrant I'llhave the room ready. Sha'n't half know it again; make it as smart as acarrot.ÓAnd then she left the house; fully satisfied that no one could blame herrefusing to inhabit it, and much less chagrined than she was willing tosuppose herself, in finding she had now no resource but in the Delviles.Yet, in her serious reflections, she could not but think herselfstrangely unfortunate that the guardian with whom alone it seemed properfor her to reside, should by parsimony, vulgarity, and meanness, renderriches contemptible, prosperity unavailing, and economy odious; andthat the choice of her uncle should thus unhappily have fallen upon thelowest and most wretched of misers, in a city abounding with opulence,hospitality, and splendour, and of which the principal inhabitants, longeminent for their wealth and their probity, were now almost universallyrising in elegance and liberality.CHAPTER ix. -- A DECLARATION.Cecilia's next progress, therefore, was to St James's-square, whithershe went in the utmost anxiety, from her uncertainty of the receptionwith which her proposal would meet.The servants informed her that Mr and Mrs Delvile were at breakfast, andthat the Duke of Derwent and his two daughters were with them.Before such witnesses to relate the reasons of her leaving the Harmlesswas impossible; and from such a party to send for Mrs Delvile, would,by her stately guardian, be deemed an indecorum unpardonable. She wasobliged, therefore, to return to Portman-square, in order to open hercause in a letter to Mrs Delvile.Mr Arnott, flying instantly to meet her, called out, ÒO madam, whatalarm has your absence occasioned! My sister believed she should see youno more, Mr Harrel feared a premature discovery of his purposed retreat,and we have all been under the cruellest apprehensions lest you meantnot to come back.ÓÒI am sorry I spoke not with you before I went out,Ó said Cecilia,accompanying him to the library, Òbut I thought you were all too muchoccupied to miss me. I have been, indeed, preparing for a removal, butI meant not to leave your sister without bidding her adieu, nor, indeed,to quit any part of the family with so little ceremony. Is Mr Harrelstill firm to his last plan?ÓÒI fear so! I have tried what is possible to dissuade him, and mypoor sister has wept without ceasing. Indeed, if she will take noconsolation, I believe I shall do what she pleases, for I cannot bearthe sight of her in such distress.ÓÒYou are too generous, and too good!Ó said Cecilia, Òand I know not how,while flying from danger myself, to forbear counselling you to avoid italso.ÓÒAh madam!Ó cried he, Òthe greatest danger for me is what I have now nopower to run from!ÓCecilia, though she could not but understand him, felt not the less hisfriend for knowing him the humblest of her admirers; and as she sawthe threatening ruin to which his too great tenderness exposed him, shekindly said ÒMr Arnott, I will speak, to you without reserve. It is notdifficult to see that the destruction which awaits Mr Harrel, is readyalso to ensnare his brother-in-law; but let not that blindness to thefuture which we have so often lamented for him, hereafter be lamentedfor yourself. Till his present connections are broken, and his way ofliving is changed, nothing can be done for him, and whatever you were toadvance, would merely be sunk at the gaming table. Reserve, therefore,your liberality till it may indeed be of service to him, for believe me,at present, his mind is as much injured as his fortune.ÓÒAnd is it possible, madam,Ó said Mr Arnott, in an accent of surprizeand delight, Òthat you can deign to be interested in what may become ofme! and that my sharing or escaping the ruin of this house is not whollyindifferent to you?ÓÒCertainly not,Ó answered Cecilia; Òas the brother of my earliestfriend, I can never be insensible to your welfare.ÓÒAh madam!Ó cried he, Òas her brother!--Oh that there were any othertie!--ÓÒThink a little,Ó said Cecilia, preparing to quit the room, Òof what Ihave mentioned, and, for your sister's sake, be firm now, if you wouldbe kind hereafter.ÓÒI will be any and every thing,Ó cried he, Òthat Miss Beverley willcommand.ÓCecilia, fearful of any misinterpretation, then came back, and gravelysaid, ÒNo, Sir, be ruled only by your own judgment; or, should myadvice have any weight with you, remember it is given from the mostdisinterested motives, and with no other view than that of securing yourpower to be of service to your sister.ÓÒFor that sister's sake, then, have the goodness to hear my situation,and honour me with further directions.ÓÒYou will make me fear to speak,Ó said Cecilia, Òif you give so muchconsequence to my opinion. I have seen, however, nothing in your conductI have ever wished changed, except too little attention to your owninterest and affairs.ÓÒAh!Ó cried he, Òwith what rapture should I hear those words, could Ibut imagine--ÓÒCome, come,Ó said Cecilia, smiling, Òno digression! You called me backto talk of your sister; if you change your subject, perhaps you may loseyour auditor.ÓÒI would not, madam, for the world encroach upon your goodness; thefavour I have found has indeed always exceeded my expectations, as ithas always surpassed my desert; yet has it never blinded me to my ownunworthiness. Do not, then, fear to indulge me with your conversation;I shall draw from it no inference but of pity, and though pity from MissBeverley is the sweetest balm to my heart, it shall never seduce me tothe encouragement of higher hopes.ÓCecilia had long had reason to expect such a declaration, yet sheheard it with unaffected concern, and looking at him with the utmostgentleness, said ÒMr Arnott, your regard does me honour, and, were itsomewhat more rational, would give me pleasure; take, then, from itwhat is more than I wish or merit, and, while you preserve the rest, beassured it will be faithfully returned.ÓÒYour rejection is so mild,Ó cried he, Òthat I, who had no hope ofacceptance, find relief in having at last told my sufferings. CouldI but continue to see you every day, and to be blest with yourconversation, I think I should be happy, and I am sure I should begrateful.ÓÒYou are already,Ó answered she, shaking her head, and moving towardsthe door, Òinfringing the conditions upon which our friendship is to befounded.ÓÒDo not go, madam,Ó he cried, Òtill I have done what you have justpromised to permit, acquainted you with my situation, and been honouredwith your advice. I must own to you, then, that £5000, which I had inthe stocks, as well as a considerable sum in a banker's hands, I haveparted with, as I now find for ever but I have no heart for refusal,nor would my sister at this moment be thus distressed, but that I havenothing more to give without I cut down my trees, or sell some farm,since all I was worth, except my landed property, is already gone. What,therefore, I can now do to save Mr Harrel from this desperate expeditionI know not.ÓÒI am sorry,Ó said Cecilia, Òto speak with severity of one so nearlyconnected with you, yet, suffer me to ask, why should he be saved fromit at all? and what is there he can at present do better? Has not helong been threatened with every evil that is now arrived? have we notboth warned him, and have not the clamours of his creditors assailedhim? yet what has been the consequence? he has not submitted to thesmallest change in his way of life, he has not denied himself a singleindulgence, nor spared any expence, nor thought of any reformation.Luxury has followed luxury, and he has only grown fonder ofextravagance, as extravagance has become more dangerous. Till thepresent storm, therefore, blows over, leave him to his fate, and when acalm succeeds, I will myself, for the sake of Priscilla, aid you to savewhat is possible of the wreck.ÓÒAll you say, madam, is as wise as it is good, and now I am acquaintedwith your opinion, I will wholly new model myself upon it, and grow assteady against all attacks as hitherto I have been yielding.ÓCecilia was then retiring; but again detaining her, he said ÒYou spoke,madam, of a removal, and indeed it is high time you should quit thisscene; yet I hope you intend not to go till to-morrow, as Mr Harrel hasdeclared your leaving him sooner will be his destruction.ÓÒHeaven forbid,Ó said Cecilia, Òfor I mean to be gone with all the speedin my power.ÓÒMr Harrel,Ó answered he, Òdid not explain himself; but I believe heapprehends your deserting his house at this critical time, will raisea suspicion of his own design of going abroad, and make his creditorsinterfere to prevent him.ÓÒTo what a wretched state,Ó cried Cecilia, Òhas he reduced himself! Iwill not, however, be the voluntary instrument of his disgrace; and ifyou think my stay is so material to his security, I will continue heretill to-morrow morning.ÓMr Arnott almost wept his thanks for this concession, and Cecilia, happyin making it to him instead of Mr Harrel, then went to her own room, andwrote the following letter to Mrs Delvile.To the Hon. Mrs Delvile, St James's-square.PORTMAN SQUARE, June 12.DEAR MADAM,--I am willing to hope you have been rather surprised thatI have not sooner availed myself of the permission with which youyesterday honoured me of spending this whole day with you, but,unfortunately for myself, I am prevented waiting upon you even for anypart of it. Do not, however, think me now ungrateful if I stay away, norto-morrow impertinent, if I venture to enquire whether that apartmentwhich you had once the goodness to appropriate to my use, may then againbe spared for me! The accidents which have prompted this strange requestwill, I trust, be sufficient apology for the liberty I take in makingit, when I have the honour to see you, and acquaint you what theyare.--I am, with the utmost respect, Dear Madam, your most obedienthumble servant, CECILIA BEVERLEY.She would not have been thus concise, had not the caution of Mr Arnottmade her fear, in the present perilous situation of affairs, to trustthe secret of Mr Harrel to paper.The following answer was returned her from Mrs Delvile;--To Miss Beverley, Portman-square.The accidents you mention are not, I hope, of a very serious nature,since I shall find difficulty insurmountable in trying to lament them,if they are productive of a lengthened visit from my dear Miss Beverleyto her Faithful humble servant, AUGUSTA DELVILE.Cecilia, charmed with this note, could now no longer forbear lookingforward to brighter prospects, flattering herself that once under theroof of Mrs Delvile, she must necessarily be happy, let the engagementsor behaviour of her son be what they might.CHAPTER x. -- A GAMESTER'S CONSCIENCE.From this soothing prospect, Cecilia was presently disturbed by MrsHarrel's maid, who came to entreat she would hasten to her lady, whomshe feared was going into fits.Cecilia flew to her immediately, and found her in the most violentaffliction. She used every kind effort in her power to quiet and consoleher, but it was not without the utmost difficulty she could sob out thecause of this fresh sorrow, which indeed was not trifling. Mr Harrel,she said, had told her he could not possibly raise money even for histravelling expences, without risking a discovery of his project, andbeing seized by his creditors; he had therefore charged her, throughher brother or her friend, to procure for him £3000, as less would notsuffice to maintain them while abroad, and he knew no method by whichhe could have any remittances without danger. And, when she hesitated inher compliance, he furiously accused her of having brought on all thisdistress by her negligence and want of management, and declared that ifshe did not get the money, she would only be served as she merited bystarving in a foreign gaol, which he swore would be the fate of themboth.The horror and indignation with which Cecilia heard this account wereunspeakable. She saw evidently that she was again to be played upon byterror and distress, and the cautions and opinions of Mr Monckton nolonger appeared overstrained; one year's income was already demanded,the annuity and the country house might next be required; she rejoiced,however, that thus wisely forewarned, she was not liable to surprise,and she determined, be their entreaties or representations what theymight, to be immovably steady in her purpose of leaving them the nextmorning.Yet she could not but grieve at suffering the whole burthen of thisclamorous imposition to fall upon the soft-hearted Mr Arnott, whoseinability to resist solicitation made him so unequal to sustaining itsweight; but when Mrs Harrel was again able to go on with her account,she heard, to her infinite surprise, that all application to her brotherhad proved fruitless. ÒHe will not hear me,Ó continued Mrs Harrel, Òandhe never was deaf to me before! so now I have lost my only and lastresource, my brother himself gives me up, and there is no one else uponearth who will assist me!ÓÒWith pleasure, with readiness, with joy,Ó cried Cecilia, Òshould youfind assistance from me, were it to you alone it were given; but tosupply fuel for the very fire that is consuming you--no, no, my wholeheart is hardened against gaming and gamesters, and neither now nor everwill I suffer any consideration to soften me in their favour.ÓMrs Harrel only answered by tears and lamentations; and Cecilia, whosejustice shut not out compassion, having now declared her purposedfirmness, again attempted to sooth her, entreating her not to give wayto such immoderate grief, since better prospects might arise fromthe very gloom now before her, and a short time spent in solitude andoeconomy, might enable her to return to her native land with recoveredhappiness.ÒNo, I shall never return!Ó cried she, weeping, ÒI shall die, I shallbreak my heart before I have been banished a month! Oh Miss Beverley,how happy are you! able to stay where you please,--rich,--rolling inwealth which you do not want,--of which had we but one year's incomeonly, all this misery would be over, and we might stay in our dear,dear, country!ÓCecilia, struck by a hint that so nearly bordered upon reproach,and offended by seeing the impossibility of ever doing enough, whileanything remained to be done, forbore not without difficulty enquiringwhat next was expected from her, and whether any part of her fortunemight be guarded, without giving room for some censure! but the deepaffliction of Mrs Harrel soon removed her resentment, and scarcelythinking her, while in a state of such wretchedness, answerable for whatshe said, after a little recollection, she mildly replied ÒAs affluenceis all comparative, you may at present think I have more than my share;but the time is only this moment past, when your own situation seemed assubject to the envy of others as mine may be now. My future destiny isyet undetermined, and the occasion I may have for my fortune is unknownto myself; but whether I possess it in peace or in turbulence, whetherit proves to me a blessing or an injury, so long as I can call it myown, I shall always remember with alacrity the claim upon that and uponme which early friendship has so justly given Mrs Harrel. Yet permitme, at the same time, to add, that I do not hold myself so entirelyindependent as you may probably suppose me. I have not, it is true, anyRelations to call me to account, but respect for their memory suppliesthe place of their authority, and I cannot, in the distribution of thefortune which has devolved to me, forbear sometimes considering how theywould have wished it should be spent, and always remembering that whatwas acquired by industry and labour, should never be dissipated inidleness and vanity. Forgive me for thus speaking to the point; you willnot find me less friendly to yourself, for this frankness with respectto your situation.ÓTears were again the only answer of Mrs Harrel; yet Cecilia, who pitiedthe weakness of her mind, stayed by her with the most patient kindnesstill the servants announced dinner. She then declared she would not godown stairs; but Cecilia so strongly represented the danger of awakeningsuspicion in the servants, that she at last prevailed with her to makeher appearance.Mr Harrel was already in the parlour, and enquiring for Mr Arnott, butwas told by the servants he had sent word he had another engagement. SirRobert Floyer also kept away, and, for the first time since her arrivalin town, Cecilia dined with no other company than the master andmistress of the house.Mrs Harrel could eat nothing; Cecilia, merely to avoid creating surprisein the servants, forbore following her example; but Mr Harrel ate muchas usual, talked all dinner-time, was extremely civil to Cecilia, anddiscovered not by his manners the least alteration in his affairs.When the servants were gone, he desired his wife to step for a momentwith him into the library. They soon returned, and then Mr Harrel,after walking in a disordered manner about the room, rang the bell, andordered his hat and cane, and as he took them, said ÒIf this fails--Ó and, stopping short, without speaking to his wife, or even bowing toCecilia, he hastily went out of the house.Mrs Harrel told Cecilia that he had merely called her to know the eventof her two petitions, and had heard her double failure in total silence.Whither he was now gone it was not easy to conjecture, nor what was thenew resource which he still seemed to think worth trying; but the mannerof his quitting the house, and the threat implied by if this fails,contributed not to lessen the grief of Mrs Harrel, and gave to Ceciliaherself the utmost alarm.They continued together till tea-time, the servants having been orderedto admit no company. Mr Harrel himself then returned, and returned, tothe amazement of Cecilia, accompanied by Mr Marriot.He presented that young man to both the ladies as a gentleman whoseacquaintance and friendship he was very desirous to cultivate. MrsHarrel, too much absorbed in her own affairs to care about any other,saw his entrance with a momentary surprise, and then thought of it nomore; but it was not so with Cecilia, whose better understanding led herto deeper reflection.Even the visits of Mr Marriot but a few weeks since Mr Harrel hadprohibited, yet he now introduced him into his house with particulardistinction; he came back too himself in admirable spirits, enlivenedin his countenance, and restored to his good humour. A change soextraordinary both in conduct and disposition convinced her that somechange no less extra-ordinary of circumstance must previously havehappened; what that might be it was not possible for her to divine, butthe lessons she had received from Mr Monckton led her to suspicions ofthe darkest kind.Every part of his behaviour served still further to confirm them; he wascivil even to excess to Mr Marriot; he gave orders aloud not to be athome to Sir Robert Floyer; he made his court to Cecilia with unusualassiduity, and he took every method in his power to procure opportunityto her admirer of addressing and approaching her.The young man, who seemed enamoured even to madness, could scarcerefrain not merely from prostration to the object of his passion, butto Mr Harrel himself for permitting him to see her. Cecilia, who notwithout some concern perceived a fondness so fruitless, and who knewnot by what arts or with what views Mr Harrel might think proper toencourage it, determined to take all the means that were in her ownpower towards giving it immediate control. She behaved, therefore,with the utmost reserve, and the moment tea was over, though earnestlyentreated to remain with them, she retired to her own room, withoutmaking any other apology than coldly saying she could not stay.In about an hour Mrs Harrel ran up stairs to her.ÒOh Miss Beverley,Ó she cried, Òa little respite is now granted me! MrHarrel says he shall stay another day; he says, too, one single thousandpound would now make him a new man.ÓCecilia returned no answer; she conjectured some new deceit was inagitation to raise money, and she feared Mr Marriot was the next dupeto be played upon. Mrs Harrel, therefore, with a look of the utmostdisappointment, left her, saying she would send for her brother, andonce more try if he had yet any remaining regard for her.Cecilia rested quiet till eleven o'clock, when she was summoned tosupper; she found Mr Marriot still the only guest, and that Mr Arnottmade not his appearance.She now resolved to publish her resolution of going the next morningto St James's-square. As soon, therefore, as the servants withdrew, sheenquired of Mr Harrel if he had any commands with Mr or Mrs Delvile, asshe should see them the next morning, and purposed to spend some timewith them.Mr Harrel, with a look of much alarm, asked if she meant the whole day.Many days, she answered, and probably some months.Mrs Harrel exclaimed her surprise aloud, and Mr Harrel looked aghast;while his new young friend cast upon him a glance of reproach andresentment, which fully convinced Cecilia he imagined he had procuredhimself a title to an easiness of intercourse and frequency of meetingwhich this intelligence destroyed. Cecilia, thinking after all that hadpassed, no other ceremony on her part was necessary but that of simplyspeaking her intention, then arose and returned to her own room.She acquainted her maid that she was going to make a visit to MrsDelvile, and gave her directions about packing up her clothes, andsending for a man in the morning to take care of her books.This employment was soon interrupted by the entrance of Mrs Harrel, whodesiring to speak with her alone, when the maid was gone, said ÒO MissBeverley, can you indeed be so barbarous as to leave me?ÓÒI entreat you, Mrs Harrel,Ó answered Cecilia, Òto save both yourselfand me any further discussions. I have delayed this removal very long,and I can now delay it no longer.ÓMrs Harrel then flung herself upon a chair in the bitterest sorrow,declaring she was utterly undone; that Mr Harrel had declared he couldnot stay even an hour in England if she was not in his house; that hehad already had a violent quarrel with Mr Marriot upon the subject; andthat her brother, though she had sent him the most earnest entreaties,would not come near her.Cecilia, tired of vain attempts to offer comfort, now urged the warmestexpostulations against her opposition, strongly representing the realnecessity of her going abroad, and the unpardonable weakness of wishingto continue such a life as she now led, adding debt to debt, andhoarding distress upon distress.Mrs Harrel then, though rather from compulsion than conviction, declaredshe would agree to go, if she had not a dread of ill usage; but MrHarrel, she said, had behaved to her with the utmost brutality, callingher the cause of his ruin, and threatening that if she procured not thisthousand pound before the ensuing evening, she should be treated as shedeserved for her extravagance and folly.ÒDoes he think, then,Ó said Cecilia with the utmost indignation, ÒthatI am to be frightened through your fears into what compliances hepleases?ÓÒO no,Ó cried Mrs Harrel, Òno; his expectations are all from my brother.He surely thought that when I supplicated and pleaded to him, he woulddo what I wished, for so he always did formerly, and so once again I amsure he would do now, could I but make him come to me, and tell himhow I am used, and tell him that if Mr Harrel takes me abroad in thishumour, I verily think in his rage he will half murder me.ÓCecilia, who well knew she was herself the real cause of Mr Arnott'sresistance, now felt her resolution waver, internally reproachingherself with the sufferings of his sister; alarmed, however, for her ownconstancy, she earnestly besought Mrs Harrel to go and compose herselffor the night, and promised to deliberate what could be done for herbefore morning.Mrs Harrel complied; but scarce was her own rest more broken thanthat of Cecilia, who, though extremely fatigued with a whole night'swatching, was so perturbed in her mind she could not close her eyes. MrsHarrel was her earliest, and had once been her dearest friend; she haddeprived her by her own advice of her customary refuge in her brother;to refuse, therefore, assistance to her seemed cruelty, though to denyit to Mr Harrel was justice; she endeavoured, therefore, to make acompromise between her judgment and compassion, by resolving thatthough she would grant nothing further to Mr Harrel while he remained inLondon, she would contribute from time to time both to his necessitiesand comfort, when once he was established elsewhere upon some plan ofprudence and economy.CHAPTER xi. -- A PERSECUTION.The next morning by five o'clock Mrs Harrel came into Cecilia's roomto know the result of her deliberation; and Cecilia, with that gracefulreadiness which accompanied all her kind offices, instantly assured herthe thousand pound should be her own, if she would consent to seek somequiet retreat, and receive it in small sums, of fifty or one hundredpounds at a time, which should be carefully transmitted, and which,by being delivered to herself, might secure better treatment from MrHarrel, and be a motive to revive his care and affection.She flew, much delighted, with this proposal to her husband; butpresently, and with a dejected look, returning, said Mr Harrel protestedhe could not possibly set out without first receiving the money. ÒIshall go myself, therefore,Ó said she, Òto my brother after breakfast,for he will not, I see, unkind as he is grown, come to me; and if I donot succeed with him, I believe I shall never come back!ÓTo this Cecilia, offended and disappointed, answered ÒI am sorry for MrArnott, but for myself I have done!ÓMrs Harrel then left her, and she arose to make immediate preparationsfor her removal to St James's-square, whither, with all the speed in herpower, she sent her books, her trunks, and all that belonged to her.When she was summoned down stairs, she found, for the first time,Mr Harrel breakfasting at the same table with his wife; they seemedmutually out of humour and comfortless, nothing hardly was spoken, andlittle was swallowed; Mr Harrel, however, was civil, but his wife wastotally silent, and Cecilia the whole time was planning how to take herleave.When the tea things were removed, Mr Harrel said, ÒYou have not, I hope,Miss Beverley, quite determined upon this strange scheme?ÓÒIndeed I have, Sir,Ó she answered, Òand already I have sent myclothes.ÓAt this information he seemed thunderstruck; but, after somewhatrecovering, said with much bitterness, ÒWell, madam, at least may Irequest you will stay here till the evening?ÓÒNo, Sir,Ó answered she coolly, ÒI am going instantly.ÓÒAnd will you not,Ó said he, with yet greater asperity, Òamuse yourselffirst with seeing bailiffs take possession of my house, and your friendPriscilla follow me to jail?ÓÒGood God, Mr Harrel!Ó exclaimed Cecilia, with uplifted hands, Òis thisa question, is this behaviour I have merited!ÓÒO no!Ó cried he with quickness, Òshould I once think that way--Ó thenrising and striking his forehead, he walked about the room.Mrs Harrel arose too, and weeping violently went away.ÒWill you at least,Ó said Cecilia, when she was gone, Òtill your affairsare settled, leave Priscilla with me? When I go into my own house, sheshall accompany me, and mean time Mr Arnott's I am sure will gladly beopen to her.ÓÒNo, no,Ó answered he, Òshe deserves no such indulgence; she has not anyreason to complain, she has been as negligent, as profuse, as expensiveas myself; she has practised neither oeconomy nor self-denial, she hasneither thought of me nor my affairs, nor is she now afflicted at anything but the loss of that affluence she has done her best towardsdiminishing.ÒAll recrimination,Ó said Cecilia, Òwere vain, or what might not MrsHarrel urge in return! but let us not enlarge upon so ungrateful asubject, the wisest and the happiest scheme now were mutually and kindlyto console each other.ÓÒConsolation and kindness,Ó cried he, with abruptness, Òare out of thequestion. I have ordered a post chaise to be here at night, and iftill then you will stay, I will promise to release you without furtherpetition if not, eternal destruction be my portion if I live to see thescene which your removal will occasion!ÓÒMy removal,Ó cried Cecilia, shuddering, Ògood heaven, and how can myremoval be of such dreadful consequence?ÓÒAsk me not,Ó cried he, fiercely, Òquestions or reasons now; the crisisis at hand, and you will soon, happen what may, know all; mean time whatI have said is a fact, and immutable; and you must hasten my end, orgive me a chance for avoiding it, as you think fit. I scarce care atthis instant which way you decide; remember, however, all I ask of youis to defer your departure; what else I have to hope is from Mr Arnott.ÓHe then left the room.Cecilia now was again a coward! In vain she called to her supportthe advice, the prophesies, the cautions of Mr Monckton, in vain sherecollected the impositions she had already seen practised, for neitherthe warnings of her counsellor, nor the lessons of her own experience,were proofs against the terrors which threats so desperate inspired; andthough more than once she determined to fly at all events from a tyrannyhe had so little right to usurp, the mere remembrance of the words ifyou stay not till night I will not live, robbed her of all courage; andhowever long she had prepared herself for this very attack, when themoment arrived, its power over her mind was too strong for resistance.While this conflict between fear and resolution was still undecided, herservant brought her the following letter from Mr Arnott.To Miss Beverley, Portman-square.June 13th, 1779.MADAM,--Determined to obey those commands which you had the goodnessto honour me with, I have absented myself from town till Mr Harrel issettled; for though I am as sensible of your wisdom as of your beauty,I find myself too weak to bear the distress of my unhappy sister, andtherefore I run from the sight, nor shall any letter or message followme, unless it comes from Miss Beverley herself, lest she should infuture refuse the only favour I dare presume to solicit, that ofsometimes deigning to honour with her directions, the most humble anddevoted of her servants, J. ARNOTT.In the midst of her apprehensions for herself and her own interest,Cecilia could not forbear rejoicing that Mr Arnott, at least, hadescaped the present storm; yet she was certain it would fall the moreheavily upon herself; and dreaded the sight of Mrs Harrel after theshock which this flight would occasion.Her expectations were but too quickly fulfilled; Mrs Harrel in a shorttime after rushed wildly into the room, calling out ÒMy brother is gone!he has left me for ever! Oh save me, Miss Beverley, save me from abuseand insult!Ó And she wept with so much violence she could utter nothingmore.Cecilia, quite tortured by this persecution, faintly asked what shecould do for her?ÒSend,Ó cried she, Òto my brother, and beseech him not to abandon me!send to him, and conjure him to advance this thousand pound!--the chaiseis already ordered,--Mr Harrel is fixed upon going,--yet he says withoutthat money we must both starve in a strange land,--O send to my cruelbrother! he has left word that nothing must follow him that does notcome from you.ÓÒFor the world, then,Ó cried Cecilia, Òwould I not baffle hisdiscretion! indeed you must submit to your fate, indeed Mrs Harrel youmust endeavour to bear it better.ÓMrs Harrel, shedding a flood of tears, declared she would try to followher advice, but again besought her in the utmost agony to send afterher brother, protesting she did not think even her life would be safein making so long a journey with Mr Harrel in his present state of mind;his character, she said, was totally changed, his gaiety, good humour,and sprightliness were turned into roughness and moroseness, and, sincehis great losses at play, he was grown so fierce and furious, that tooppose him even in a trifle, rendered him quite outrageous in passion.Cecilia, though truly concerned, and almost melted, yet refused tointerfere with Mr Arnott, and even thought it but justice to acknowledgeshe had advised his retreat.ÒAnd can you have been so cruel?Ó cried Mrs Harrel, with stillencreasing violence of sorrow, Òto rob me of my only friend, to depriveme of my Brother's affection, at the very time I am forced out of thekingdom, with a husband who is ready to murder me, and who says he hatesthe sight of me, and all because I cannot get him this fatal, fatalmoney!--O Miss Beverley, how could I have thought to have had such anoffice from you?ÓCecilia was beginning a justification, when a message came from MrHarrel, desiring to see his wife immediately.Mrs Harrel, in great terror, cast herself at Cecilia's feet, andclinging to her knees, called out ÒI dare not go to him! I dare not goto him! he wants to know my success, and when he hears my brother is runaway, I am sure he will kill me!--Oh Miss Beverley, how could you sendhim away? how could you be so inhuman as to leave me to the rage of MrHarrel?ÓCecilia, distressed and trembling herself, conjured her to rise andbe consoled; but Mrs Harrel, weak and frightened, could only weep andsupplicate; ÒI don't ask you,Ó she cried, Òto give the money yourself,but only to send for my brother, that he may protect me, and beg MrHarrel not to treat me so cruelly,--consider but what a long, longjourney I am going to make! consider how often you used to say you wouldlove me for ever! consider you have robbed me of the tenderest brotherin the world!--Oh Miss Beverley, send for him back, or be a sister to meyourself, and let not your poor Priscilla leave her native land withouthelp or pity!ÓCecilia, wholly overcome, now knelt too, and embracing her with tears,said ÒOh Priscilla, plead and reproach no more! what you wish shall beyours,--I will send for your brother,--I will do what you please!ÓÒNow you are my friend indeed!Ó cried Mrs Harrel, Òlet me but see mybrother, and his heart will yield to my distress, and he will soften MrHarrel by giving his unhappy sister this parting bounty.ÓCecilia then took a pen in her hand to write to Mr Arnott; but struckalmost in the same moment with a notion of treachery in calling him froma retreat which her own counsel made him seek, professedly to exposehim to a supplication which from his present situation might lead himto ruin, she hastily flung it from her, and exclaimed ÒNo, excellent MrArnott, I will not so unworthily betray you!ÓÒAnd can you, Miss Beverley, can you at last,Ó cried Mrs Harrel, Òbe sobarbarous as to retract?ÓÒNo, my poor Priscilla,Ó answered Cecilia, ÒI cannot so cruellydisappoint you; my pity shall however make no sufferer but myself,--Icannot send for Mr Arnott,--from me you must have the money, and mayit answer the purpose for which it is given, and restore to you thetenderness of your husband, and the peace of your own heart!ÓPriscilla, scarce waiting to thank her, flew with this intelligence toMr Harrel; who with the same impetuosity, scarce waiting to say he wasglad of it, ran himself to bring the Jew from whom the money was tobe procured. Every thing was soon settled, Cecilia had no time forretracting, and repentance they had not the delicacy to regard; again,therefore, she signed her name for paying the principal and interest ofanother 1000l. within ten days after she was of age; and havingtaken the money, she accompanied Mr and Mrs Harrel into another room.Presenting it then with an affecting solemnity to Mrs Harrel, Òaccept,Priscilla,Ó she cried, Òthis irrefragable mark of the sincerity of myfriendship; but suffer me at the same time to tell you, it is thelast to so considerable an amount I ever mean to offer; receive it,therefore, with kindness, but use it with discretion.ÓShe then embraced her, and eager now to avoid acknowledgment, as beforeshe had been to escape importunities, she left them together.The soothing recompense of succouring benevolence, followed not thisgift, nor made amends for this loss; perplexity and uneasiness, regretand resentment, accompanied the donation, and rested upon her mind; shefeared she had done wrong; she was certain Mr Monckton would blameher; he knew not the persecution she suffered, nor would he make anyallowance for the threats which alarmed, or the intreaties which meltedher.Far other had been her feelings at the generosity she exerted for theHills; no doubts then tormented her, and no repentance embittered herbeneficence. Their worth was without suspicion, and their misfortuneswere not of their own seeking; the post in which they had been stationedthey had never deserted, and the poverty into which they had sunk wasaccidental and unavoidable.But here, every evil had been wantonly incurred by vanity andlicentiousness, and shamelessly followed by injustice and fraud; thedisturbance of her mind only increased by reflection, for when therights of the creditors with their injuries occurred to her, sheenquired of herself by what title or equity, she had so liberallyassisted Mr Harrel in eluding their claims, and flying the punishmentwhich the law would inflict.Startled by this consideration, she most severely reproached herself fora compliance of which she had so lightly weighed the consequences, andthought with the utmost dismay, that while she had flattered herselfshe was merely indulging the dictates of humanity, she might perhaps beaccused by the world as an abettor of guile and injustice.ÒAnd yet,Ó she continued, Òwhom can I essentially have injured butmyself? would his creditors have been benefitted by my refusal? hadI braved the execution of his dreadful threat, and quitted his housebefore I was wrought upon to assist him, would his suicide have lessenedtheir losses, or secured their demands? even if he had no intention butto intimidate me, who will be wronged by my enabling him to go abroad,or who would be better paid were he seized and confined? All thatremains of his shattered fortune may still be claimed, though I havesaved him from a lingering imprisonment, desperate for himself and hiswife, and useless for those he has plundered.ÓAnd thus, now soothed by the purity of her intentions, and now uneasyfrom the rectitude of her principles, she alternately rejoiced andrepined at what she had done.At dinner Mr Harrel was all civility and good humour. He warmly thankedCecilia for the kindness she had shewn him, and gaily added, ÒYou shouldbe absolved from all the mischief you may do for a twelvemonth to come,in reward for the preservation from mischief which you have this dayeffected.ÓÒThe preservation,Ó said Cecilia, Òwill I hope be for many days. Buttell me, sir, exactly, at what time I may acquaint Mrs Delvile I shallwait upon her?ÓÒPerhaps,Ó he answered, Òby eight o'clock; perhaps by nine; you will notmind half an hour?ÓÒCertainly not;Ó she answered, unwilling by disputing about a trifleto diminish his satisfaction in her assistance. She wrote, therefore,another note to Mrs Delvile, desiring she would not expect her till nearten o'clock, and promising to account and apologize for these seemingcaprices when she had the honour of seeing her.The rest of the afternoon she spent wholly in exhorting Mrs Harrel toshew more fortitude, and conjuring her to study nothing while abroadbut oeconomy, prudence and housewifery; a lesson how hard for thethoughtless and negligent Priscilla! she heard the advice withrepugnance, and only answered it with helpless complaints that she knewnot how to spend less money than she had always done.After tea, Mr Harrel, still in high spirits, went out, entreatingCecilia to stay with Priscilla till his return, which he promised shouldbe early.Nine o'clock, however, came, and he did not appear; Cecilia then grewanxious to keep her appointment with Mrs Delvile; but ten o'clock alsocame, and still Mr Harrel was absent.She then determined to wait no longer, and rang her bell for her servantand chair; but when Mrs Harrel desired to be informed the moment thatMr Harrel returned, the man said he had been come home more than half anhour.Much surprised, she enquired where he was.ÒIn his own room, madam, and gave orders not to be disturbed.ÓCecilia, who was not much pleased at this account, was easily persuadedto stay a few minutes longer; and, fearing some new evil, she was goingto send him a message, by way of knowing how he was employed, when hecame himself into the room.ÒWell, ladies,Ó he cried in a hurrying manner, Òwho is for Vauxhall?ÓÒVauxhall!Ó repeated Mrs Harrel, while Cecilia, staring, perceived inhis face a look of perturbation that extremely alarmed her.ÒCome, come,Ó he cried, Òwe have no time to lose. A hackney coach willserve us; we won't wait for our own.ÓÒHave you then given up going abroad?Ó said Mrs Harrel.ÒNo, no; where can we go from half so well? let us live while we live! Ihave ordered a chaise to be in waiting there. Come, let's be gone.ÓÒFirst,Ó said Cecilia, Òlet me wish you both good night.ÓÒWill you not go with me?Ó cried Mrs Harrel, Òhow can I go to Vauxhallalone?ÓÒYou are not alone,Ó answered she; Òbut if I go, how am I to return?ÓÒShe shall return with you,Ó cried Mr Harrel, Òif you desire it; youshall return together.ÓMrs Harrel, starting up in rapture, called out ÒOh Mr Harrel, will youindeed leave me in England?ÓÒYes,Ó answered he reproachfully, Òif you will make a better friend thanyou have made a wife, and if Miss Beverley is content to take charge ofyou.ÓÒWhat can all this mean?Ó exclaimed Cecilia, Òis it possible you can beserious? Are you really going yourself, and will you suffer Mrs Harrelto remain?ÓÒI am,Ó he answered, Òand I will.ÓThen ringing the bell, he ordered a hackney coach.Mrs Harrel was scarce able to breathe for extacy, nor Cecilia foramazement; while Mr Harrel, attending to neither of them, walked forsome time silently about the room.ÒBut how,Ó cried Cecilia at last, Òcan I possibly go? Mrs Delvile mustalready be astonished at my delay, and if I disappoint her again shewill hardly receive me.ÓÒO make not any difficulties,Ó cried Mrs Harrel in an agony; Òif MrHarrel will let me stay, sure you will not be so cruel as to opposehim?ÓÒBut why,Ó said Cecilia, Òshould either of us go to Vauxhall? surelythat is no place for a parting so melancholy.ÓA servant then came in, and said the hackney coach was at the door.Mr Harrel, starting at the sound, called out, Òcome, what do we waitfor? if we go not immediately, we may be prevented.ÓCecilia then again wished them good night, protesting she could fail MrsDelvile no longer.Mrs Harrel, half wild at this refusal, conjured her in the most franticmanner, to give way, exclaiming, ÒOh cruel! cruel! to deny me this lastrequest! I will kneel to you day and night,Ó sinking upon the groundbefore her, Òand I will serve you as the humblest of your slaves, if youwill but be kind in this last instance, and save me from banishment andmisery!ÓÒOh rise, Mrs Harrel,Ó cried Cecilia, ashamed of her prostration, andshocked by her vehemence, Òrise and let me rest!--it is painful to meto refuse, but to comply for ever in defiance of my judgment--Oh MrsHarrel, I know no longer what is kind or what is cruel, nor have I knownfor some time past right from wrong, nor good from evil!ÓÒCome,Ó cried Mr Harrel impetuously, ÒI wait not another minute!ÓÒLeave her then with me!Ó said Cecilia, ÒI will perform my promise, MrArnott will I am sure hold his to be sacred, she shall now go with him,she shall hereafter come to me,--leave her but behind, and depend uponour care.ÓÒNo, no,Ó cried he, with quickness, ÒI must take care of her myself. Ishall not carry her abroad with me, but the only legacy I can leave her,is a warning which I hope she will remember for ever. You, however, neednot go.ÓÒWhat,Ó cried Mrs Harrel, Òleave me at Vauxhall, and yet leave mealone?ÓÒWhat of that?Ó cried he with fierceness, Òdo you not desire to be left?have you any regard for me? or for any thing upon earth but yourself!cease these vain clamours, and come, I insist upon it, this moment.ÓAnd then, with a violent oath, he declared he would be detained nolonger, and approached in great rage to seize her; Mrs Harrel shriekedaloud, and the terrified Cecilia exclaimed, ÒIf indeed you are to partto-night, part not thus dreadfully!--rise, Mrs Harrel, and comply!--bereconciled, be kind to her, Mr Harrel!--and I will go with hermyself,--we will all go together!ÓÒAnd why,Ó cried Mr Harrel, more gently yet with the utmost emotion,Òwhy should you go!--you want no warning! you need no terror!--betterfar had you fly us, and my wife when I am set out may find you.ÓMrs Harrel, however, suffered her not to recede; and Cecilia, thoughhalf distracted by the scenes of horror and perplexity in which she wasperpetually engaged, ordered her servant to acquaint Mrs Delvile she wasagain compelled to defer waiting upon her.Mr Harrel then hurried them both into the coach, which he directed toVauxhall.ÒPray write to me when you are landed,Ó said Mrs Harrel, who nowreleased from her personal apprehensions, began to feel some for herhusband.He made not any answer. She then asked to what part of France he meantto go; but still he did not reply; and when she urged him by a thirdquestion, he told her in a rage to torment him no more.During the rest of the ride not another word was said; Mrs Harrel wept,her husband guarded a gloomy silence, and Cecilia most unpleasantlypassed her time between anxious suspicions of some new scheme, and aterrified wonder in what all these transactions would terminate.CHAPTER xii. -- A MAN OF BUSINESS.When they entered Vauxhall, Mr Harrel endeavoured to dismiss hismoroseness, and affecting his usual gaiety, struggled to recover hisspirits; but the effort was vain, he could neither talk nor look likehimself, and though from time to time he resumed his air of wontedlevity, he could not support it, but drooped and hung his head inevident despondency.He made them take several turns in the midst of the company, and walkedso fast that they could hardly keep pace with him, as if he hoped byexercise to restore his vivacity; but every attempt failed, he sunk andgrew sadder, and muttering between his teeth Òthis is not to be borne!Ó he hastily called to a waiter to bring him a bottle of champagne.Of this he drank glass after glass, notwithstanding Cecilia, as MrsHarrel had not courage to speak, entreated him to forbear. He seemed,however, not to hear her; but when he had drunk what he thoughtnecessary to revive him, he conveyed them into an unfrequented partof the garden, and as soon as they were out of sight of all but a fewstragglers, he suddenly stopt, and, in great agitation, said, Òmy chaisewill soon be ready, and I shall take of you a long farewell!--all myaffairs are unpropitious to my speedy return;--the wine is now mountinginto my head, and perhaps I may not be able to say much by and by. Ifear I have been cruel to you, Priscilla, and I begin to wish Ihad spared you this parting scene; yet let it not be banished yourremembrance, but think of it when you are tempted to such mad folly ashas ruined us.ÓMrs Harrel wept too much to make any answer; and turning from her toCecilia, ÒOh Madam,Ó he cried, Òto you, indeed, I dare not speak! I haveused you most unworthily, but I pay for it all! I ask you not to pity orforgive me, I know it is impossible you should do either.ÓÒNo,Ó cried the softened Cecilia, Òit is not impossible, I do both atthis moment, and I hope--ÓÒDo not hope,Ó interrupted he, Òbe not so angelic, for I cannot bear it!benevolence like yours should have fallen into worthier hands. But come,let us return to the company. My head grows giddy, but my heart is stillheavy; I must make them more fit companions for each other.ÓHe would then have hurried them back; but Cecilia, endeavouring to stophim, said ÒYou do not mean, I hope, to call for more wine?ÓÒWhy not?Ó cried he, with affected spirit, Òwhat, shall we not be merrybefore we part? Yes, we will all be merry, for if we are not, how shallwe part at all?--Oh not without a struggle!--Ó Then, stopping, he pauseda moment, and casting off the mask of levity, said in accents the mostsolemn ÒI commit this packet to you,Ó giving a sealed parcel to Cecilia;Òhad I written it later, its contents had been kinder to my wife, fornow the hour of separation approaches, ill will and resentment subside.Poor Priscilla!--I am sorry--but you will succour her, I am sure youwill,--Oh had I known you myself before this infatuation--bright patternof all goodness!--but I was devoted,--a ruined wretch before ever youentered my house; unworthy to be saved, unworthy that virtues such asyours should dwell under the same roof with me! But come,--come now, ormy resolution will waver, and I shall not go at last.ÓÒBut what is this packet?Ó cried Cecilia, Òand why do you give it tome?ÓÒNo matter, no matter, you will know by and by;--the chaise waits, and Imust gather courage to be gone.ÓHe then pressed forward, answering neither to remonstrance nor intreatyfrom his frightened companions.The moment they returned to the covered walk, they were met by MrMarriot; Mr Harrel, starting, endeavoured to pass him; but when heapproached, and said Òyou have sent, Sir, no answer to my letter!Ó hestopt, and in a tone of forced politeness, said, ÒNo, Sir, but I shallanswer it to-morrow, and to-night I hope you will do me the honour ofsupping with me.ÓMr Marriot, looking openly at Cecilia as his inducement, thoughevidently regarding himself as an injured man, hesitated a moment, yetaccepted the invitation.ÒTo supper?Ó cried Mrs Harrel, Òwhat here?ÓÒTo supper?Ó repeated Cecilia, Òand how are we to get home?ÓÒThink not of that these two hours,Ó answered he; Òcome, let us look fora box.ÓCecilia then grew quite urgent with him to give up a scheme which mustkeep them so late, and Mrs Harrel repeatedly exclaimed ÒIndeed peoplewill think it very odd to see us here without any party;Ó but he heededthem not, and perceiving at some distance Mr Morrice, he called outto him to find them a box; for the evening was very pleasant, and thegardens were so much crowded that no accommodation was unseized.ÒSir,Ó cried Morrice, with his usual readiness, ÒI'll get you one if Iturn out ten old Aldermen sucking custards.ÓJust after he was gone, a fat, sleek, vulgar-looking man, dressed ina bright purple coat, with a deep red waistcoat, and a wig bulging farfrom his head with small round curls, while his plump face and personannounced plenty and good living, and an air of defiance spoke thefullness of his purse, strutted boldly up to Mr Harrel, and accostinghim in a manner that shewed some diffidence of his reception, but noneof his right, said ÒSir your humble servant.Ó And made a bow first tohim, and then to the ladies.ÒSir yours,Ó replied Mr Harrel scornfully, and without touching his hathe walked quickly on.His fat acquaintance, who seemed but little disposed to be offended withimpunity, instantly replaced his hat on his head, and with a look thatimplied I'll fit you for this! put his hands to his sides, and followinghim, said ÒSir, I must make bold to beg the favour of exchanging a fewwords with you.ÓÒAy, Sir,Ó answered Mr Harrel, Òcome to me to-morrow, and you shallexchange as many as you please.ÓÒNothing like the time present, Sir,Ó answered the man; Òas forto-morrow, I believe it intends to come no more; for I have heard of itany time these three years. I mean no reflections, Sir, but let everyman have his right. That's what I say, and that's my notion of things.ÓMr Harrel, with a violent execration, asked what he meant by dunning himat such a place as Vauxhall?ÒOne place, Sir,Ó he replied, Òis as good as another place; for so aswhat one does is good, 'tis no matter for where it may be. A man ofbusiness never wants a counter if he can meet with a joint-stool. For mypart, I'm all for a clear conscience, and no bills without receipts tothem.ÓÒAnd if you were all for broken bones,Ó cried Mr Harrel, angrily, ÒIwould oblige you with them without delay.ÓÒSir,Ó cried the man, equally provoked, Òthis is talking quite outof character, for as to broken bones, there's ne'er a person in allEngland, gentle nor simple, can say he's a right to break mine, for I'mnot a person of that sort, but a man of as good property as another man;and there's ne'er a customer I have in the world that's more his own manthan myself.ÓÒLord bless me, Mr Hobson,Ó cried Mrs Harrel, Òdon't follow us in thismanner! If we meet any of our acquaintance they'll think us half crazy.ÓÒMa'am,Ó answered Mr Hobson, again taking off his hat, Òif I'm treatedwith proper respect, no man will behave more generous than myself; butif I'm affronted, all I can say is, it may go harder with some folksthan they think for.ÓHere a little mean-looking man, very thin, and almost bent double withperpetual cringing, came up to Mr Hobson, and pulling him by the sleeve,whispered, yet loud enough to be heard, ÒIt's surprizeable to me, MrHobson, you can behave so out of the way! For my part, perhaps I've asmuch my due as another person, but I dares to say I shall have it whenit's convenient, and I'd scorn for to mislest a gentleman when he'staking his pleasure.ÓÒLord bless me,Ó cried Mrs Harrel, Òwhat shall we do now? here's all MrHarrel's creditors coming upon us!ÓÒDo?Ó cried Mr Harrel, re-assuming an air of gaiety, Òwhy give themall a supper, to be sure. Come, gentlemen, will you favour me with yourcompany to supper?ÓÒSir,Ó answered Mr Hobson, somewhat softened by this unexpectedinvitation, ÒI've supped this hour and more, and had my glass too, forI'm as willing to spend my money as another man; only what I say isthis, I don't chuse to be cheated, for that's losing one's substance,and getting no credit; however, as to drinking another glass, or such amatter as that, I'll do it with all the pleasure in life.ÓÒAnd as to me,Ó said the other man, whose name was Simkins, and whosehead almost touched the ground by the profoundness of his reverence,ÒI can't upon no account think of taking the liberty; but if I mayjust stand without, I'll make bold to go so far as just for to drink myhumble duty to the ladies in a cup of cyder.ÓÒAre you mad, Mr Harrel, are you mad!Ó cried his wife, Òto think ofasking such people as these to supper? what will every body say? supposeany of our acquaintance should see us? I am sure I shall die withshame.ÓÒMad!Ó repeated he, Òno, not mad but merry. O ho, Mr Morrice, why haveyou been so long? what have you done for us?ÓÒWhy Sir,Ó answered Morrice, returning with a look somewhat less elatedthan he had set out, Òthe gardens are so full, there is not a box to behad; but I hope we shall get one for all that; for I observed one of thebest boxes in the garden, just to the right there, with nobody in it butthat gentleman who made me spill the tea-pot at the Pantheon. So I madean apology, and told him the case; but he only said humph? and hay? sothen I told it all over again, but he served me just the same, for henever seems to hear what one says till one's just done, and then hebegins to recollect one's speaking to him; however, though I repeatedit all over and over again, I could get nothing from him but just thathumph? and hay? but he is so remarkably absent, that I dare say if weall go and sit down round him, he won't know a word of the matter.ÓÒWon't he?Ó cried Mr Harrel, Òhave at him, then!ÓAnd he followed Mr Morrice, though Cecilia, who now half suspected thatall was to end in a mere idle frolic, warmly joined her remonstrances tothose of Mrs Harrel, which were made with the utmost, but with fruitlessearnestness.Mr Meadows, who was seated in the middle of the box, was lolloping uponthe table with his customary ease, and picking his teeth with his usualinattention to all about him. The intrusion, however, of so largea party, seemed to threaten his insensibility with unavoidabledisturbance; though imagining they meant but to look in at the box,and pass on, he made not at their first approach any alteration in hisattitude or employment.ÒSee, ladies,Ó cried the officious Morrice, ÒI told you there was room;and I am sure this gentleman will be very happy to make way for you, ifit's only out of good-nature to the waiters, as he is neither eating nordrinking, nor doing any thing at all. So if you two ladies will go in atthat side, Mr Harrel and that other gentleman,Ó pointing to Mr Marriot,Òmay go to the other, and then I'll sit by the ladies here, and thoseother two gentlemen--ÓHere Mr Meadows, raising himself from his reclining posture, and staringMorrice in the face, gravely said, ÒWhat's all this, Sir!ÓMorrice, who expected to have arranged the whole party without aquestion, and who understood so little of modish airs as to suspectneither affectation nor trick in the absence of mind and indolence ofmanners which he observed in Mr Meadows, was utterly amazed by thisinterrogatory, and staring himself in return, said, ÒSir, you seemed sothoughtful--I did not think--I did not suppose you would have taken anynotice of just a person or two coming into the box.ÓÒDid not you, Sir?Ó said Mr Meadows very coldly, Òwhy then now you do,perhaps you'll be so obliging as to let me have my own box to myself.ÓAnd then again he returned to his favourite position.ÒCertainly, Sir,Ó said Morrice, bowing; ÒI am sure I did not mean todisturb you; for you seemed so lost in thought, that I'm sure I did notmuch believe you would have seen us.ÓÒWhy Sir,Ó said Mr Hobson, strutting forward, Òif I may speak myopinion, I should think, as you happen to be quite alone, a littleagreeable company would be no such bad thing. At least that's mynotion.ÓÒAnd if I might take the liberty,Ó said the smooth tongued Mr Simkins,Òfor to put in a word, I should think the best way would be, if thegentleman has no peticklar objection, for me just to stand somewherehereabouts, and so, when he's had what he's a mind to, be ready for topop in at one side, as he comes out at the t'other; for if one does notlook pretty 'cute such a full night as this, a box is whipt away beforeone knows where one is.ÓÒNo, no, no,Ó cried Mrs Harrel impatiently, Òlet us neither sup in thisbox nor in any other; let us go away entirely.ÓÒIndeed we must! indeed we ought!Ó cried Cecilia; Òit is utterlyimproper we should stay; pray let us be gone immediately.ÓMr Harrel paid not the least regard to these requests; but Mr Meadows,who could no longer seem unconscious of what passed, did himself so muchviolence as to arise, and ask if the ladies would be seated.ÒI said so!Ó cried Morrice triumphantly, ÒI was sure there was nogentleman but would be happy to accommodate two such ladies!ÓThe ladies, however, far from happy in being so accommodated, againtried their utmost influence in persuading Mr Harrel to give up thisscheme; but he would not hear them, he insisted upon their going intothe box, and, extending the privilege which Mr Meadows had given, heinvited without ceremony the whole party to follow.Mr Meadows, though he seemed to think this a very extraordinaryencroachment, had already made such an effort from his general languorin the repulse he had given to Morrice, that he could exert himself nofurther; but after looking around him with mingled vacancy and contempt,he again seated himself, and suffered Morrice to do the honours withoutmore opposition. Morrice, but too happy in the office, placed Cecilianext to Mr Meadows, and would have made Mr Marriot her other neighbour,but she insisted upon not being parted from Mrs Harrel, and therefore,as he chose to sit also by that lady himself, Mr Marriot was obligedto follow Mr Harrel to the other side of the box; Mr Hobson, withoutfurther invitation, placed himself comfortably in one of the corners,and Mr Simkins, who stood modestly for some time in another, findingthe further encouragement for which he waited was not likely to arrive,dropt quietly into his seat without it.Supper was now ordered, and while it was preparing Mr Harrel sat totallysilent; but Mr Meadows thought proper to force himself to talk withCecilia, though she could well have dispensed with such an exertion ofhis politeness.ÒDo you like this place, ma'am?ÓÒIndeed I hardly know,--I never was here before.ÓÒNo wonder! the only surprise is that any body can come to it at all. Tosee a set of people walking after nothing! strolling about without viewor object! 'tis strange! don't you think so, ma'am?ÓÒYes,--I believe so,Ó said Cecilia, scarce hearing him.ÒO it gives me the vapours, the horrors,Ó cried he, Òto see what poorcreatures we all are! taking pleasure even from the privation of it!forcing ourselves into exercise and toil, when we might at least havethe indulgence of sitting still and reposing!ÓÒLord, Sir,Ó cried Morrice, Òdon't you like walking?ÓÒWalking?Ó cried he, ÒI know nothing so humiliating; to see a rationalbeing in such mechanical motion! with no knowledge upon what principleshe proceeds, but plodding on, one foot before another, without even anyconsciousness which is first, or how either--ÓÒSir,Ó interrupted Mr Hobson, ÒI hope you won't take it amiss if I makebold to tell my opinion, for my way is this, let every man speak hismaxim! But what I say as to this matter, is this, if a man must alwaysbe stopping to consider what foot he is standing upon, he had need havelittle to do, being the right does as well as the left, and the left aswell as the right. And that, Sir, I think is a fair argument.ÓMr Meadows deigned no other answer to this speech than a look ofcontempt.ÒI fancy, Sir,Ó said Morrice, Òyou are fond of riding, for all your goodhorsemen like nothing else.ÓÒRiding!Ó exclaimed Mr Meadows, ÒOh barbarous! Wrestling and boxingare polite arts to it! trusting to the discretion of an animal lessintellectual than ourselves! a sudden spring may break all our limbs,a stumble may fracture our sculls! And what is the inducement? to getmelted with heat, killed with fatigue, and covered with dust! miserableinfatuation!--Do you love riding, ma'am?ÓÒYes, very well, Sir.ÓÒI am glad to hear it,Ó cried he, with a vacant smile; Òyou are quiteright; I am entirely of your opinion.ÓMr Simkins now, with a look of much perplexity, yet rising and bowing,said ÒI don't mean, Sir, to be so rude as to put in my oar, but if I didnot take you wrong, I'm sure just now I thought you seemed for to makeno great 'count of riding, and yet now, all of the sudden, one wouldthink you was a speaking up for it!ÓÒWhy, Sir,Ó cried Morrice, Òif you neither like riding nor walking, youcan have no pleasure at all but only in sitting.ÓÒSitting!Ó repeated Mr Meadows, with a yawn, ÒO worse and worse! itdispirits me to death! it robs me of all fire and life! it weakenscirculation, and destroys elasticity.ÓÒPray then, Sir,Ó said Morrice, Òdo you like any better to stand?ÓÒTo stand? O intolerable! the most unmeaning thing in the world! one hadbetter be made a mummy!ÓÒWhy then, pray Sir,Ó said Mr Hobson, Òlet me ask the favour of you totell us what it is you do like?ÓMr Meadows, though he stared him full in the face, began picking histeeth without making any answer.ÒYou see, Mr Hobson,Ó said Mr Simkins, Òthe gentleman has no mind forto tell you; but if I may take the liberty just to put in, I think if heneither likes walking, nor riding, nor sitting, nor standing, I take ithe likes nothing.ÓÒWell, Sir,Ó said Morrice, Òbut here comes supper, and I hope you willlike that. Pray Sir, may I help you to a bit of this ham?ÓMr Meadows, not seeming to hear him, suddenly, and with an air ofextreme weariness, arose, and without speaking to anybody, abruptlymade his way out of the box. -- Mr Harrel now, starting from the gloomyreverie into which he had sunk, undertook to do the honours of thetable, insisting with much violence upon helping every body, callingfor more provisions, and struggling to appear in high spirits and goodhumour.In a few minutes Captain Aresby, who was passing by the box, stopt tomake his compliments to Mrs Harrel and Cecilia.ÒWhat a concourse!Ó he cried, casting up his eyes with an expression ofhalf-dying fatigue, Òare you not accabl? for my part, I hardly respire.I have really hardly ever had the honour of being so obsed before.ÓÒWe can make very good room, Sir,Ó said Morrice, Òif you chuse to comein.ÓÒYes,Ó said Mr Simkins, obsequiously standing up, ÒI am sure thegentleman will be very welcome to take my place, for I did not mean forto sit down, only just to look agreeable.ÓÒBy no means, Sir,Ó answered the Captain; ÒI shall be quite au desespoirif I derange any body.ÓÒSir,Ó said Mr Hobson, ÒI don't offer you my place, because I takeit for granted if you had a mind to come in, you would not stand uponceremony; for what I say is, let every man speak his mind, and then weshall all know how to conduct ourselves. That's my way, and let any mantell me a better!ÓThe Captain, after looking at him with a surprise not wholly unmixt withhorror, turned from him without making any answer, and said to Cecilia,ÒAnd how long, ma'am, have you tried this petrifying place?ÓÒAn hour,--two hours, I believe,Ó she answered.ÒReally? and nobody here! assez de monde, but nobody here! a blankpartout!ÓÒSir,Ó said Mr Simkins, getting out of the box that he might bowwith more facility, ÒI humbly crave pardon for the liberty, but if Iunderstood right, you said something of a blank? pray, Sir, if I maybe so free, has there been any thing of the nature of a lottery, or araffle, in the garden? or the like of that?ÓÒSir!Ó said the Captain, regarding him from head to foot, ÒI am quiteassomm that I cannot comprehend your allusion.ÓÒSir, I ask pardon,Ó said the man, bowing still lower, ÒI only thoughtif in case it should not be above half a crown, or such a matter asthat, I might perhaps stretch a point once in a way.ÓThe Captain, more and more amazed, stared at him again, but not thinkingit necessary to take any further notice of him, he enquired of Ceciliaif she meant to stay late.ÒI hope not,Ó she replied, ÒI have already stayed later than I wished todo.ÓÒReally!Ó said he, with an unmeaning smile, ÒWell, that is as horrid athing as I have the malheur to know. For my part, I make it a principlenot to stay long in these semi-barbarous places, for after a certaintime, they bore me to that degree I am quite abim. I shall, however, domon possible to have the honour of seeing you again.ÓAnd then, with a smile of yet greater insipidity, he protested he wasreduced to despair in leaving her, and walked on.ÒPray, ma'am, if I may be so bold,Ó said Mr Hobson, Òwhat countryman maythat gentleman be?ÓÒAn Englishman, I suppose, Sir,Ó said Cecilia.ÒAn Englishman, ma'am!Ó said Mr Hobson, Òwhy I could not understand oneword in ten that came out of his mouth.ÓÒWhy indeed,Ó said Mr Simkins, Òhe has a mighty peticklar way ofspeaking, for I'm sure I thought I could have sworn he said something ofa blank, or to that amount, but I could make nothing of it when I cometo ask him about it.ÓÒLet every man speak to be understood,Ó cried Mr Hobson, Òthat's mynotion of things; for as to all those fine words that nobody can makeout, I hold them to be of no use. Suppose a man was to talk in thatmanner when he's doing business, what would be the upshot? who'dunderstand what he meant? Well, that's the proof; what i'n't fit forbusiness, i'n't of no value; that's my way of judging, and that's what Igo upon.ÓÒHe said some other things,Ó rejoined Mr Simkins, Òthat I could not makeout very clear, only I had no mind to ask any more questions, for fearof his answering me something I should not understand; but as well as Icould make it out, I thought I heard him say there was nobody here! whathe could mean by that, I can't pretend for to guess, for I'm sure thegarden is so stock full, that if there was to come many more, I don'tknow where they could cram 'em.ÓÒI took notice of it at the time,Ó said Mr Hobson, Òfor it i'n't manythings are lost upon me; and, to tell you the truth, I thought he hadbeen making pretty free with his bottle, by his seeing no better.ÓÒBottle!Ó cried Mr Harrel, Òa most excellent hint, Mr Hobson! come! letus all make free with the bottle!ÓHe then called for more wine, and insisted that every body should pledgehim. Mr Marriot and Mr Morrice made not any objection, and Mr Hobson andMr Simkins consented with much delight.Mr Harrel now grew extremely unruly, the wine he had already drunk beingthus powerfully aided; and his next project was to make his wife andCecilia follow his example. Cecilia, more incensed than ever to seeno preparation made for his departure, and all possible pains takento unfit him for setting out, refused him with equal firmness anddispleasure, and lamented, with the bitterest self-reproaches, theconsent which had been forced from her to be present at a scene of suchdisorder; but Mrs Harrel would have opposed him in vain, had not hisattention been called off to another object. This was Sir Robert Floyer,who perceiving the party at some distance, no sooner observed Mr Marriotin such company, than advancing to the box with an air of rage anddefiance, he told Mr Harrel he had something to say to him.ÒAy,Ó cried Harrel, Òsay to me? and so have I to say to you! Comeamongst us and be merry! Here, make room, make way! Sit close, myfriends!ÓSir Robert, who now saw he was in no situation to be reasoned with,stood for a moment silent; and then, looking round the box, andobserving Messrs Hobson and Simkins, he exclaimed aloud ÒWhy what queerparty have you got into? who the d---l have you picked up here?ÓMr Hobson, who, to the importance of lately acquired wealth, now addedthe courage of newly drunk Champagne, stoutly kept his ground, withoutseeming at all conscious he was included in this interrogation; but MrSimkins, who had still his way to make in the world, and whose habitualservility would have resisted a larger draught, was easily intimidated;he again, therefore stood up, and with the most cringing respect offeredthe Baronet his place; who, taking neither of the offer nor offerer thesmallest notice, still stood opposite to Mr Harrel, waiting for someexplanation.Mr Harrel, however, who now grew really incapable of giving any, onlyrepeated his invitation that he would make one among them.ÒOne among you?Ó cried he, angrily, and pointing to Mr Hobson, Òwhy youdon't fancy I'll sit down with a bricklayer?ÓÒA bricklayer?Ó said Mr Harrel, Òay, sure, and a hosier too; sit down,Mr Simkins, keep your place, man!ÓMr Simkins most thankfully bowed; but Mr Hobson, who could no longeravoid feeling the personality of this reflection, boldly answered,ÒSir, you may sit down with a worse man any day in the week! I have donenothing I'm ashamed of, and no man can say to me why did you so? I don'ttell you, Sir, what I'm worth; no one has a right to ask; I only saythree times five is fifteen! that's all.ÓÒWhy what the d----l, you impudent fellow,Ó cried the haughty Baronet,Òyou don't presume to mutter, do you?ÓÒSir,Ó answered Mr Hobson, very hotly, ÒI sha'n't put up with abuse fromno man! I've got a fair character in the world, and wherewithal to liveby my own liking. And what I have is my own, and all I say is, letevery one say the same, for that's the way to fear no man, and face thed----l.ÓÒWhat do you mean by that, fellow?Ó cried Sir Robert.ÒFellow, Sir! this is talking no how. Do you think a man of substance,that's got above the world, is to be treated like a little scrubbyapprentice? Let every man have his own, that's always my way ofthinking; and this I can say for myself, I have as good a right to shewmy head where I please as ever a member of parliament in all England;and I wish every body here could say as much.ÓSir Robert, fury starting into his eyes, was beginning an answer; butMrs Harrel with terror, and Cecilia with dignity, calling upon them bothto forbear, the Baronet desired Morrice to relinquish his place to him,and seating himself next to Mrs Harrel, gave over the contest.Meanwhile Mr Simkins, hoping to ingratiate himself with the company,advanced to Mr Hobson, already cooled by finding himself unanswered, andreproachfully said ÒMr Hobson, if I may make so free, I must needs bebold to say I am quite ashamed of you! a person of your standing andcredit for to talk so disrespectful! as if a gentleman had not a rightto take a little pleasure, because he just happens to owe you a littlematters of money; fie, fie, Mr Hobson! I did not expect you to behave sodespiseable!ÓÒDespiseable!Ó answered Mr Hobson, ÒI'd scorn as much to do anythingdespiseable as yourself, or any thing misbecoming of a gentleman; and asto coming to such a place as this may be, why I have no objection to it.All I stand to is this, let every man have his due; for as to taking alittle pleasure, here I am, as one may say, doing the same myself; butwhere's the harm of that? who's a right to call a man to account that'sclear of the world? Not that I mean to boast, nor nothing like it, but,as I said before; five times five is fifteen; [Footnote; I hardlyknow whether the authoress has here forgotten her arithmetic, orintentionally suffered Mr Hobson to forget his, from the effects ofchampagne.--Ed.]--that's my calculation.ÓMr Harrel, who, during this debate, had still continued drinking,regardless of all opposition from his wife and Cecilia, now grew moreand more turbulent; he insisted that Mr Simkins should return to hisseat, ordered him another bumper of champagne, and saying he had nothalf company enough to raise his spirits, desired Morrice to go andinvite more.Morrice, always ready to promote a frolic, most chearfully consented;but when Cecilia, in a low voice, supplicated him to bring no one back,with still more readiness he made signs that he understood and wouldobey her.Mr Harrel then began to sing, and in so noisy and riotous a manner, thatnobody approached the box without stopping to stare at him; and thosewho were new to such scenes, not contented with merely looking in,stationed themselves at some distance before it, to observe what waspassing, and to contemplate with envy and admiration an appearance ofmirth and enjoyment which they attributed to happiness and pleasure!Mrs Harrel, shocked to be seen in such mixed company, grew every instantmore restless and miserable; and Cecilia, half distracted to think howthey were to get home, had passed all her time in making secret vowsthat if once again she was delivered from Mr Harrel she would never seehim more.Sir Robert Floyer perceiving their mutual uneasiness, proposed to escortthem home himself; and Cecilia, notwithstanding her aversion to him,was listening to the scheme, when Mr Marriot, who had been evidentlyprovoked and disconcerted since the junction of the Baronet, suspectingwhat was passing, offered his services also, and in a tone of voice thatdid not promise a very quiet acquiescence in a refusal.Cecilia, who, too easily, in their looks, saw all the eagerness ofrivalry, now dreaded the consequence of her decision, and thereforedeclined the assistance of either; but her distress was unspeakable,as there was not one person in the party to whose care she could commitherself, though the behaviour of Mr Harrel, which every moment grewmore disorderly, rendered the necessity of quitting him urgent anduncontroulable.When Morrice returned, stopping in the midst of his loud and violentsinging, he vehemently demanded what company he had brought him?ÒNone at all, sir,Ó answered Morrice, looking significantly at Cecilia;ÒI have really been so unlucky as not to meet with any body who had amind to come.ÓÒWhy then,Ó answered he, starting up, ÒI will seek some for myself.Ó ÒO no, pray, Mr Harrel, bring nobody else,Ó cried his wife. ÒHear us inpity,Ó cried Cecilia, Òand distress us no further.ÓÒDistress you?Ó cried he, with quickness, Òwhat shall I not bring youthose pretty girls? Yes, one more glass, and I will teach you to welcomethem.ÓAnd he poured out another bumper.ÒThis is so insupportable!Ó cried Cecilia, rising, Ò[that] I can remainhere no longer.ÓÒThis is cruel indeed,Ó cried Mrs. Harrel, bursting into tears; Òdid youonly bring me here to insult me?ÓÒNo!Ó cried he, suddenly embracing her, Òby this parting kiss!Ó thenwildly jumping upon his seat, he leapt over the table, and was out ofsight in an instant.Amazement seized all who remained; Mrs Harrel and Cecilia, indeed,doubted not but he was actually gone to the chaise he had ordered; butthe manner of his departure affrighted them, and his preceding behaviourhad made them cease to expect it; Mrs Harrel, leaning upon Cecilia,continued to weep, while she, confounded and alarmed, scarce knewwhether she should stay and console her, or fly after Mr Harrel, whomshe feared had incapacitated himself from finding his chaise, by thevery method he had taken to gather courage for seeking it.This, however, was but the apprehension of a moment; another and a farmore horrible one drove it from her imagination; for scarcely had MrHarrel quitted the box and their sight, before their ears were suddenlystruck with the report of a pistol.Mrs Harrel gave a loud scream, which was involuntarily echoed by,Cecilia; everybody arose, some with officious zeal to serve the ladies,and others to hasten to the spot whence the dreadful sound proceeded.Sir Robert Floyer again offered his services in conducting them home;but they could listen to no such proposal; Cecilia, with difficultyrefrained from rushing out herself to discover what was passing; buther dread of being followed by Mrs Harrel prevented her; they both,therefore, waited, expecting every instant some intelligence, as all butthe Baronet and Mr Marriot were now gone to seek it.Nobody, however, returned; and their terrors encreased every moment;Mrs Harrel wanted to run out herself, but Cecilia, conjuring her to keepstill, begged Mr Marriot to bring them some account. Mr Marriot, likethe messengers who had preceded him, came not back; an instant seemed anage, and Sir Robert Floyer was also entreated to procure information.Mrs Harrel and Cecilia were now left to themselves, and their horrorwas too great for speech or motion; they stood close to each other,listening to every sound and receiving every possible addition to theiralarm, by the general confusion which they observed in the gardens, inwhich, though both gentlemen and waiters were running to and fro, not acreature was walking, and all amusement seemed forgotten.From this dreadful state they were at length removed, though notrelieved, by the sight of a waiter, who, as he was passing shewedhimself almost covered with blood! Mrs Harrel vehemently called afterhim, demanding whence it came? ÒFrom the gentleman, ma'am,Ó answered hein haste, Òthat has shot himself,Ó and then ran on.Mrs Harrel uttered a piercing scream, and sunk on the ground; forCecilia, shuddering with horror, lost all her own strength, and could nolonger lend her any support.So great at this time was the general confusion of the place, that forsome minutes their particular distress was unknown, and their situationunnoticed; till at length an elderly gentleman came up to the box, andhumanely offered his assistance.Cecilia, pointing to her unfortunate friend, who had not fallen into afainting fit, but merely from weakness and terror, accepted his help inraising her. She was lifted up, however, without the smallest effort onher own part, and was only kept upon her seat by being held there by thestranger, for Cecilia, whose whole frame was shaking, tried in vain tosustain her.This gentleman, from the violence of their distress, began now tosuspect its motive, and addressing himself to Cecilia, said, ÒI amafraid, madam, this unfortunate gentleman was some Relation to you?ÓNeither of them spoke, but their silence was sufficiently expressive.ÒIt is pity, madam,Ó he continued, Òthat some friend can't order him outof the crowd, and have him kept quiet till a surgeon can be brought.ÓÒA surgeon!Ó exclaimed Cecilia, recovering from one surprize by theeffect of another; Òis it then possible he may be saved?ÓAnd without waiting to have her question answered, she ran out of thebox herself, flying wildly about the garden, and calling for help as sheflew, till she found the house by the entrance; and then, going upto the bar, ÒIs a surgeon sent for?Ó she exclaimed, Òlet a surgeon befetched instantly!Ó ÒA surgeon, ma'am,Ó she was answered, Òis not thegentleman dead?Ó ÒNo, no, no!Ó she cried; Òhe must be brought in; letsome careful people go and bring him in.Ó Nor would she quit the bar,till two or three waiters were called, and received her orders. Andthen, eager to see them executed herself, she ran, fearless of beingalone, and without thought of being lost, towards the fatal spot whitherthe crowd guided her. She could not, indeed, have been more secure frominsult or molestation if surrounded by twenty guards; for the scene ofdesperation and horror which many had witnessed, and of which all hadheard the signal, engrossed the universal attention, and took, even fromthe most idle and licentious, all spirit for gallantry and amusement.Here, while making vain attempts to penetrate through the multitude,that she might see and herself judge the actual situation of Mr Harrel,and give, if yet there was room for hope, such orders as would bestconduce to his safety and recovery, she was met by Mr Marriot, whoentreated her not to press forward to a sight which he had found tooshocking for himself, and insisted upon protecting her through thecrowd.ÒIf he is alive,Ó cried she, refusing his aid, Òand if there is anychance he may be saved, no sight shall be too shocking to deter me fromseeing him properly attended.ÓÒAll attendance,Ó answered he, Òwill be in vain; he is not indeed,yet dead, but his recovery is impossible. There is a surgeon with himalready; one who happened to be in the gardens, and he told me himselfthat the wound was inevitably mortal.ÓCecilia, though greatly disappointed, still determined to make way tohim, that she might herself enquire if, in his last moments, there wasany thing he wished to communicate, or desired to have done; but, as shestruggled to proceed, she was next met and stopt by Sir Robert Floyer,who, forcing her back, acquainted her that all was over!The shock with which she received this account, though unmixed with anytenderness of regret, and resulting merely from general humanity,was yet so violent as almost to overpower her. Mr Harrel, indeed, hadforfeited all right to her esteem, and the unfeeling selfishness ofhis whole behaviour had long provoked her resentment and excited herdisgust; yet a catastrophe so dreadful, and from which she had herselfmade such efforts to rescue him, filled her with so much horror, that,turning extremely sick, she was obliged to be supported to the nearestbox, and stop there for hartshorn and water.A few minutes, however, sufficed to divest her of all care for herself,in the concern with which she recollected the situation of Mrs Harrel;she hastened, therefore, back to her, attended by the Baronet and MrMarriot, and found her still leaning upon the stranger, and weepingaloud.The fatal news had already reached her; and though all affection betweenMr Harrel and herself had mutually subsided from the first two or threemonths of their marriage, a conclusion so horrible to all connectionbetween them could not be heard without sorrow and distress. Hertemper, too, naturally soft, retained not resentment, and Mr Harrel, nowseparated from her for ever, was only remembered as the Mr Harrel whofirst won her heart.Neither pains nor tenderness were spared on the part of Cecilia toconsole her; who finding her utterly incapable either of acting ordirecting for herself, and knowing her at all times to be extremelyhelpless, now summoned to her own aid all the strength of mind shepossessed, and determined upon this melancholy occasion, both to thinkand act for her widowed friend to the utmost stretch of her abilitiesand power.As soon, therefore, as the first effusions of her grief were over, sheprevailed with her to go to the house, where she was humanely offeredthe use of a quiet room till she should be better able to set off fortown. Cecilia, having seen her thus safely lodged, begged Mr Marriot tostay with her, and then, accompanied by the Baronet, returned herselfto the bar, and desiring the footman who had attended them to be called,sent him instantly to his late master, and proceeded next with greatpresence of mind, to inquire further into the particulars of what hadpassed, and to consult upon what was immediately to be done with thedeceased; for she thought it neither decent nor right to leave to chanceor to strangers the last duties which could be paid him.He had lingered, she found, about a quarter of an hour, but in acondition too dreadful for description, quite speechless, and, by allthat could be judged, out of his senses; yet so distorted with pain, andwounded so desperately beyond any power of relief, that the surgeon, whoevery instant expected his death, said it would not be merely uselessbut inhuman, to remove him till he had breathed his last. He died,therefore, in the arms of this gentleman and a waiter.ÒA waiter!Ó cried Cecilia, reproachfully looking at Sir Robert, Òand wasthere no friend who for the few poor moments that remained had patienceto support him?ÓÒWhere would be the good,Ó said Sir Robert, Òof supporting a man in hislast agonies?ÓThis unfeeling speech she attempted not to answer, but, sufferingneither her dislike to him, nor her scruples for herself, to interferewith the present occasion, she desired to have his advice what was nowbest to be done.Undertaker's men must immediately, he said, be sent for, to remove thebody.She then gave orders for that purpose, which were instantly executed.Whither the body was to go was the next question; Cecilia wished theremoval to be directly to the townhouse, but Sir Robert told her it mustbe carried to the nearest undertaker's, and kept there till it could beconveyed to town in a coffin.For this, also, in the name of Mrs Harrel, she gave directions. And thenaddressing herself to Sir Robert, ÒYou will now Sir, I hope,Ó she said,Òreturn to the fatal spot, and watch by your late unfortunate friendtill the proper people arrive to take charge of him?ÓÒAnd what good will that do?Ó cried he; Òhad I not better watch by you?ÓÒIt will do good,Ó answered she, with some severity, Òto decency and tohumanity; and surely you cannot refuse to see who is with him, and inwhat situation he lies, and whether he has met, from the strangers withwhom he was left, the tenderness and care which his friends ought tohave paid him.ÓÒWill you promise, then,Ó he answered, Ònot to go away till I come back?for I have no great ambition to sacrifice the living for the dead.ÓÒI will promise nothing, Sir,Ó said she, shocked at his callousinsensibility; Òbut if you refuse this last poor office, I must applyelsewhere; and firmly I believe there is no other I can ask who will amoment hesitate in complying.ÓShe then went back to Mrs Harrel, leaving, however, an impressionupon the mind of Sir Robert, that made him no longer dare dispute hercommands.Her next solicitude was how they should return to town; they had noequipage of their own, and the only servant who came with them wasemployed in performing the last duties for his deceased master. Herfirst intention was to order a hackney coach, but the deplorable stateof Mrs Harrel made it almost impossible she could take the sole care ofher, and the lateness of the night, and their distance from home, gaveher a dread invincible to going so far without some guard or assistant.Mr Marriot earnestly desired to have the honour of conveying them toPortman-square in his own carriage, and notwithstanding there were manyobjections to such a proposal, the humanity of his behaviour upon thepresent occasion, and the evident veneration which accompanied hispassion, joined to her encreasing aversion to the Baronet, from whomshe could not endure to receive the smallest obligation, determined her,after much perplexity and hesitation, to accept his offer.She begged him, therefore, to immediately order his coach, and, happy toobey her, he went out with that design; but, instantly coming back,told her, in a low voice, that they must wait some time longer, as theUndertaker's people were then entering the garden, and if they stayednot till the removal had taken place, Mrs Harrel might be shocked withthe sight of some of the men, or perhaps even meet the dead body.Cecilia, thanking him for this considerate precaution, readily agreed todefer setting out; devoting, mean time, all her attention to Mrs Harrel,whose sorrow, though violent, forbad not consolation. But before thegarden was cleared, and the carriage ordered, Sir Robert returned;saying to Cecilia, with an air of parading obedience which seemed toclaim some applause, ÒMiss Beverley, your commands have been executed.ÓCecilia made not any answer, and he presently added, ÒWhenever you chuseto go I will order up my coach.ÓÒMy coach, Sir,Ó said Mr Marriot, Òwill be ordered when the ladies areready, and I hope to have the honour myself of conducting them to town.ÓÒNo, Sir,Ó cried the Baronet, Òthat can never be; my long acquaintancewith Mrs Harrel gives me a prior right to attend her, and I can by nomeans suffer any other person to rob me of it.ÓÒI have nothing,Ó said Mr Marriot, Òto say to that, Sir, but MissBeverley herself has done me the honour to consent to make use of mycarriage.ÓÒMiss Beverley, I think,Ó said Sir Robert, extremely piqued, Òcan neverhave sent me out of the way in order to execute her own commands, merelyto deprive me of the pleasure of attending her and Mrs Harrel home.ÓCecilia, somewhat alarmed, now sought to lessen the favour of herdecision, though she adhered to it without wavering.ÒMy intention,Ó said she, Òwas not to confer, but to receive anobligation; and I had hoped, while Mr. Marriot assisted us, Sir Robertwould be far more humanely employed in taking charge of what wecannot superintend, and yet are infinitely more anxious should not beneglected.ÓÒThat,Ó said Sir Robert, Òis all done; and I hope, therefore, aftersending me upon such an errand, you don't mean to refuse me the pleasureof seeing you to town?ÓÒSir Robert,Ó said Cecilia, greatly displeased, ÒI cannot argue withyou now; I have already settled my plan, and I am not at leisure tore-consider it.ÓSir Robert bit his lips for a moment in angry silence; but not enduringto lose the victory to a young rival he despised, he presently said, ÒIfI must talk no more about it to you, madam, I must at least beg leaveto talk of it to this gentleman, and take the liberty to represent tohim--ÓCecilia now, dreading how his speech might be answered, prevented itsbeing finished, and with an air of the most spirited dignity, said, ÒIsit possible, sir, that at a time such as this, you should not be whollyindifferent to a matter so frivolous? little indeed will be the pleasurewhich our society can afford! your dispute however, has given it someimportance, and therefore Mr Marriot must accept my thanks for hiscivility, and excuse me for retracting my consent.ÓSupplications and remonstrances were, however, still poured upon herfrom both, and the danger, the impossibility that two ladies could go totown alone, in a hackney coach, and without even a servant, at near fouro'clock in the morning, they mutually urged, vehemently entreating thatshe would run no such hazard.Cecilia was far other than insensible to these representations; thedanger, indeed, appeared to her so formidable, that her inclination thewhole time opposed her refusal; yet her repugnance to giving way to theoverbearing Baronet, and her fear of his resentment if she listened toMr Marriot, forced her to be steady, since she saw that her preferencewould prove the signal of a quarrel.Inattentive, therefore, to their joint persecution, she againdeliberated by what possible method she could get home in safety; butunable to devise any, she at last resolved to make enquiries of thepeople in the bar, who had been extremely humane and civil, whether theycould assist or counsel her. She therefore desired the two gentlemen totake care of Mrs Harrel, to which neither dared dissent, as both couldnot refuse, and hastily arising, went out of the room; but greatindeed was her surprize when, as she was walking up to the bar, she wasaddressed by young Delvile!Approaching her with that air of gravity and distance which of latehe had assumed in her presence, he was beginning some speech about hismother; but the instant the sound of his voice reached Cecilia, shejoyfully clasped her hands, and eagerly exclaimed, ÒMr Delvile!--O nowwe are safe!--this is fortunate indeed!ÓÒSafe, Madam,Ó cried he astonished, Òyes I hope so!--has any thingendangered your safety?ÓÒO no matter for danger,Ó cried she, Òwe will now trust ourselves withyou, and I am sure you will protect us.ÓÒProtect you!Ó repeated he again, and with warmth, Òyes, while Ilive!--but what is the matter?--why are you so pale?--are you ill?--areyou frightened?--what is the matter?ÓAnd losing all coldness and reserve, with the utmost earnestness hebegged her to explain herself.ÒDo you not know,Ó cried she, Òwhat has happened? Can you be here andnot have heard it?ÓÒHeard what?Ó cried he, ÒI am but this moment arrived; my mother grewuneasy that she did not see you, she sent to your house, and was toldthat you were not returned from Vauxhall; some other circumstances alsoalarmed her, and therefore, late as it was, I came hither myself. Theinstant I entered this place, I saw you here. This is all myhistory; tell me now yours. Where is your party? where are Mr and MrsHarrel?--Why are you alone?ÓÒO ask not!Ó cried she, ÒI cannot tell you!--take us but under yourcare, and you will soon know all.ÓShe then hurried from him, and returning to Mrs Harrel, said she had nowa conveyance at once safe and proper, and begged her to rise and comeaway.The gentlemen, however, rose first, each of them declaring he wouldhimself attend them.ÒNo,Ó said Cecilia, steadily, Òthat trouble will now be superfluous; MrsDelvile herself has sent for me, and her son is now waiting till we joinhim.ÓAmazement and disappointment at this intelligence were visible in thefaces of them both; Cecilia waited not a single question, but findingshe was unable to support Mrs Harrel, who rather suffered herself tobe carried than led, she entrusted her between them, and ran forward toenquire of Delvile if his carriage was ready.She found him with a look of horror that told the tale he had beenhearing, listening to one of the waiters; the moment she appeared,he flew to her, and with the utmost emotion exclaimed, ÒAmiable MissBeverley! what a dreadful scene have you witnessed! what a cruel taskhave you nobly performed! such spirit with such softness! so muchpresence of mind with such feeling!--but you are all excellence! humannature can rise no higher! I believe indeed you are its most perfectornament!ÓPraise such as this, so unexpected, and delivered with such energy,Cecilia heard not without pleasure, even at a moment when her whole mindwas occupied by matters foreign to its peculiar interests. She made,however, her enquiry about the carriage, and he told her that he hadcome in a hackney coach, which was waiting for him at the door.Mrs Harrel was now brought in, and little was the recompense herassistants received for their aid, when they saw Cecilia so contentedlyengaged with young Delvile, whose eyes were rivetted on her face, withan expression of the most lively admiration; each, however, then quittedthe other, and hastened to the fair mourner; no time was now lost, MrsHarrel was supported to the coach, Cecilia followed her, and Delvile,jumping in after them, ordered the man to drive to Portman-square.Sir Robert and Mr Marriot, confounded though enraged, saw theirdeparture in passive silence; the right of attendance they had sotenaciously denied to each other, here admitted not of dispute; Delvileupon this occasion, appeared as the representative of his father, andhis authority seemed the authority of a guardian. Their only consolationwas that neither had yielded to the other, and all spirit of altercationor revenge was sunk in their mutual mortification. At the petition ofthe waiters, from sullen but proud emulation, they paid the expences ofthe night, and then throwing themselves into their carriages, returnedto their respective houses.CHAPTER xiii. -- A SOLUTION.During the ride to town, not merely Cecilia, but Delvile himselfattended wholly to Mrs Harrel, whose grief as it became less violent,was more easy to be soothed.The distress of this eventful night was however not yet over; when theycame to Portman-square, Delvile eagerly called to the coachman not todrive up to the house, and anxiously begged Cecilia and Mrs Harrel tosit still, while he went out himself to make some enquiries. They weresurprised at the request, yet immediately consented; but before he hadquitted them, Davison, who was watching their return, came up to themwith information that an execution was then in the house.Fresh misery was now opened for Mrs Harrel, and fresh horror andperplexity for Cecilia; she had no longer, however, the whole weighteither of thought or of conduct upon herself; Delvile in her cares tookthe most animated interest, and beseeching her to wait a moment andappease her friend, he went himself into the house to learn the state ofthe affair.He returned in a few minutes, and seemed in no haste to communicatewhat he had heard, but entreated them both to go immediately to StJames's-square.Cecilia felt extremely fearful of offending his father by theintroduction of Mrs Harrel; yet she had nothing better to propose, andtherefore, after a short and distressed argument, she complied.Delvile then told her that the alarm of his mother, at which he hadalready hinted, proceeded from a rumour of this very misfortune, towhich, though they knew not whether they might give credit, was owingthe anxiety which at so late an hour, had induced him to go to Vauxhallin search of her. They gained admittance without any disturbance, asthe servant of young Delvile had been ordered to sit up for his master.Cecilia much disliked thus taking possession of the house in thenight-time, though Delvile, solicitous to relieve her, desired she wouldnot waste a thought upon the subject, and making his servant shew herthe room which had been prepared for her reception, he begged her tocompose her spirits, and to comfort her friend, and promised to acquainthis father and mother when they arose with what had happened, that shemight be saved all pain from surprise or curiosity when they met.This service she thankfully accepted, for she dreaded, after theliberty she had taken, to encounter the pride of Mr Delvile without someprevious apology, and she feared still more to see his lady without thesame preparation, as her frequent breach of appointment might reasonablyhave offended her, and as her displeasure would affect her more deeply.It was now near six o'clock, yet the hours seemed as long as they weremelancholy till the family arose. They settled to remain quiet till somemessage was sent to them, but before any arrived, Mrs Harrel, who wasseated upon the bed, wearied by fatigue and sorrow, cried herself tosleep like a child.Cecilia rejoiced in seeing this reprieve from affliction, though herkeener sensations unfitted her from partaking of it; much indeed wasthe uneasiness which kept her awake; the care of Mrs Harrel seemed todevolve upon herself, the reception she might meet from the Delvileswas uncertain, and the horrible adventures of the night, refused for amoment to quit her remembrance.At ten o'clock, a message was brought from Mrs Delvile, to know whetherthey were ready for breakfast. Mrs Harrel was still asleep, but Ceciliacarried her own answer by hastening down stairs.In her way she was met by young Delvile, whose air upon firstapproaching her spoke him again prepared to address her with the mostdistant gravity; but almost the moment he looked at her, he forgot hispurpose; her paleness, the heaviness of her eyes, and the fatigue oflong watching betrayed by her whole face, again, surprised him into allthe tenderness of anxiety, and he enquired after her health not as acompliment of civility, but as a question in which his whole heart wasmost deeply interested.Cecilia thanked him for his attention to her friend the night before,and then proceeded to his mother.Mrs Delvile, coming forward to meet her, removed at once all her fearsof displeasure, and banished all necessity of apology, by instantlyembracing her, and warmly exclaiming ÒCharming Miss Beverley! how shallI ever tell you half the admiration with which I have heard of yourconduct! The exertion of so much fortitude at a juncture when a weakermind would have been overpowered by terror, and a heart less under thedominion of well-regulated principles, would have sought only its ownrelief by flying from distress and confusion, shews such propriety ofmind as can only result from the union of good sense with virtue. Youare indeed a noble creature! I thought so from the moment I beheld you;I shall think so, I hope, to the last that I live!ÓCecilia, penetrated with joy and gratitude, felt in that instant theamplest recompense for all that she had suffered, and for all that shehad lost. Such praise from Mrs Delvile was alone sufficient to makeher happy; but when she considered whence it sprung, and that thecircumstances with which she was so much struck, must have been relatedto her by her son, her delight was augmented to an emotion the mostpleasing she could experience, from seeing how high she was held in theesteem of those who were highest in her own.Mrs Delvile then, with the utmost cordiality, began to talk of heraffairs, saving her the pain of proposing the change of habitation thatnow seemed unavoidable, by an immediate invitation to her house, whichshe made with as much delicacy as if Mr Harrel's had still been opento her, and choice, not necessity, had directed her removal. The wholefamily, she told her, went into the country in two days, and she hopedthat a new scene, with quietness and early hours, would restore boththe bloom and sprightliness which her late cares and restlessness hadinjured. And though she very seriously lamented the rash action of MrHarrel, she much rejoiced in the acquisition which her own house andhappiness would receive from her society.She next discussed the situation of her widowed friend, and Ceciliaproduced the packet which had been entrusted to her by her late husband.Mrs Delvile advised her to open it in the presence of Mr Arnott, andbegged her to send for any other of her friends she might wish to see orconsult, and to claim freely from herself whatever advice or assistanceshe could bestow.And then, without waiting for Mr Delvile, she suffered her to swallowa hasty breakfast, and return to Mrs Harrel, whom she had desired theservants to attend, as she concluded that in her present situation shewould not chuse to make her appearance.Cecilia, lightened now from all her cares, more pleased than ever withMrs Delvile, and enchanted that at last she was settled under her roof,went back with as much ability as inclination to give comfort to MrsHarrel. She found her but just awaking, and scarce yet conscious whereshe was, or why not in her own house.As her powers of recollection returned, she was soothed with the softestcompassion by Cecilia, who in pursuance of Mrs Delvile's advice,sent her servant in search of Mr Arnott, and in consequence of herpermission, wrote a note of invitation to Mr Monckton.Mr Arnott, who was already in town, soon arrived; his own man, whom hehad left to watch the motions of Mr Harrel, having early in the morningrode to the place of his retreat, with the melancholy tidings of thesuicide and execution.Cecilia instantly went down stairs to him. The meeting was extremelypainful to them both. Mr Arnott severely blamed himself for his flight,believing it had hastened the fatal blow, which some further sacrificesmight perhaps have eluded; and Cecilia half repented the advice she hadgiven him, though the failure of her own efforts proved the situation ofMr Harrel too desperate for remedy.He then made the tenderest enquiries about his sister, and entreatedher to communicate to him the minutest particulars of the dreadfultransaction; after which, she produced the packet, but neither of themhad the courage to break the seal; and concluding the contents would beno less than his last will, they determined some third person should bepresent when they opened it. Cecilia wished much for Mr Monckton, but ashis being immediately found was uncertain, and the packet might consistof orders which ought not to be delayed, she proposed, for the sake ofexpedition, to call in Mr Delvile.Mr Arnott readily agreed, and she sent to beg a moment's audience withthat gentleman.She was desired to walk into the breakfast-room, where he was sittingwith his lady and his son.Not such was now her reception as when she entered that apartmentbefore; Mr Delvile looked displeased and out of humour, and, making hera stiff bow, while his son brought her a chair, coldly said, ÒIf youare hurried, Miss Beverley, I will attend you directly; if not, I willfinish my breakfast, as I shall have but little time the rest of themorning, from the concourse of people upon business, who will crowd uponme till dinner, most of whom will be extremely distressed if I leavetown without contriving to see them.ÓÒThere is not the least occasion, Sir,Ó answered Cecilia, Òthat I shouldtrouble you to quit the room I merely came to beg you would have thegoodness to be present while Mr Arnott opens a small packet which waslast night put into my hands by Mr Harrel.ÓÒAnd has Mr Arnott,Ó answered he, somewhat sternly, Òthought proper tosend me such a request?ÓÒNo, Sir,Ó said Cecilia, Òthe request is mine; and if, as I now fear, itis impertinent, I must entreat you to forget it.ÓÒAs far as relates merely to yourself,Ó returned Mr Delvile, Òit isanother matter; but certainly Mr Arnott can have no possible claim uponmy time or attention; and I think it rather extraordinary, that a youngman with whom I have no sort of connection or commerce, and whose veryname is almost unknown to me, should suppose a person in my style oflife so little occupied as to be wholly at his command.ÓÒHe had no such idea, Sir,Ó said Cecilia, greatly disconcerted; Òthehonour of your presence is merely solicited by myself, and simply fromthe apprehension that some directions may be contained in the paperswhich, perhaps, ought immediately to be executed.ÓÒI am not, I repeat,Ó said Mr Delvile, more mildly, Òdispleased at yourpart of this transaction; your want of experience and knowledge of theworld makes you not at all aware of the consequences which may follow mycompliance; the papers you speak of may perhaps be of great importance,and hereafter the first witness to their being read may be publicklycalled upon. You know not the trouble such an affair may occasion, butMr Arnott ought to be better informed.ÓCecilia, making another apology for the error which she had committed,was in no small confusion, quitting the room; but Mr Delvile,perfectly appeased by seeing her distress, stopt her, to say, with muchgraciousness, ÒFor your sake, Miss Beverley, I am sorry I cannot act inthis business; but you see how I am situated! overpowered with affairsof my own, and people who can do nothing without my orders. Besides,should there hereafter be any investigation into the matter, my namemight, perhaps, be mentioned, and it would be superfluous to say how illI should think it used by being brought into such company.ÓCecilia then left the rooms secretly vowing that no possible exigenceshould in future tempt her to apply for assistance to Mr Delvile, which,however ostentatiously offered, was constantly withheld when claimed.She was beginning to communicate to Mr Arnott her ill success, whenyoung Delvile, with an air of eagerness, followed her into the room.ÒPardon me,Ó he cried, Òfor this intrusion,--but, tell me, is itimpossible that in this affair I can represent my father? may not theoffice you meant for him, devolve upon me? remember how near we are toeach other, and honour me for once with supposing us the same!ÓAh who, or what, thought Cecilia, can be so different? She thanked him,with much sweetness, for his offer, but declined accepting it, saying ÒIwill not, now I know the inconveniencies of my request, be so selfish aseven to suffer it should be granted.ÓÒYou must not deny me,Ó cried he; Òwhere is the packet? why should youlose a moment?ÓÒRather ask,Ó answered she, Òwhy I should permit you to lose a momentin a matter that does not concern you? and to risk, perhaps, the loss ofmany moments hereafter, from a too incautious politeness.ÓÒAnd what can I risk,Ó cried he, Òhalf so precious as your smallestsatisfaction? do you suppose I can flatter myself with a possibility ofcontributing to it, and yet have the resolution to refuse myself somuch pleasure? no, no, the heroic times are over, and self-denial is nolonger in fashion!ÓÒYou are very good,Ó said Cecilia; Òbut indeed after what has passed--ÓÒNo matter for what has passed,Ó interrupted he, Òwe are now to thinkof what is to come. I know you too well to doubt your impatience in theexecution of a commission which circumstances have rendered sacred; andshould any thing either be done or omitted contrary to the directionsin your packet, will you not be apt, blameless as you are, to disturbyourself with a thousand fears that you took not proper methods for thedischarge of your trust?ÓThere was something in this earnestness so like his former behaviour,and so far removed from his late reserve, that Cecilia, who perceivedit with a pleasure she could hardly disguise, now opposed him no longer,but took up the packet, and broke the seal.And then, to her no small amazement, instead of the expected will, shefound a roll of enormous bills, and a collection of letters from variouscreditors, threatening the utmost severity of the law if their demandswere longer unanswered.Upon a slip of paper which held these together, was written, in MrHarrel's hand, To be all paid to-night with a BULLET.Next appeared two letters of another sort; the first of which was fromSir Robert Floyer, and in these words;Sir,--As all prospects are now over of the alliance, I hope you willexcuse my reminding you of the affair at Brookes's of last Christmas. Ihave the honour to be, Sir, yours R. FLOYER.The other was from Mr Marriot.Sir,--Though I should think £2000 nothing for the smallest hope, I musttake the liberty to say I think it a great deal for only ten minutes;you can't have forgot, Sir, the terms of our agreement, but as I findyou cannot keep to them, I must beg to be off also on my side, and Iam persuaded you are too much a man of honour to take advantage of myover-eagerness in parting with my money without better security. I am,Sir, your most humble servant, A. Marriot.What a scene of fraud, double-dealing, and iniquity was here laid open!Cecilia, who at first meant to read every thing aloud, found the attemptutterly vain, for so much was she shocked, that she could hardly read onto herself.Last of all appeared a paper in Mr Harrel's own hand-writing, containingthese words.For Mrs Harrel, Miss Beverley, and Mr Arnott.I can struggle no longer, the last blow must now be struck! another dayrobs me of my house and my liberty, and blasts me by the fatal discoveryof my double attempts.This is what I have wished; wholly to be freed, or ruined past allresource, and driven to the long-projected remedy.A burthen has my existence been these two years, gay as I have appeared;not a night have I gone to bed, but heated and inflamed from a gamingtable; not a morning have I awaked, but to be soured with a dun!I would not lead such a life again, if the slave who works hardest atthe oar would change with me.Had I a son, I would bequeath him a plough; I should then leave himhappier than my parents left me.Idleness has been my destruction; the want of something to do led meinto all evil.A good wife perhaps might have saved me,--mine, I thank her! tried not.Disengaged from me and my affairs, her own pleasures and amusementshave occupied her solely. Dreadful will be the catastrophe she will seeto-night; let her bring it home, and live better!If any pity is felt for me, it will be where I have least deserved it!Mr Arnott--Miss Beverley! it will come from you!To bring myself to this final resolution, hard, I confess, have been myconflicts; it is not that I have feared death, no, I have long wishedit, for shame and dread have embittered my days; but something thereis within me that causes a deeper horror, that asks my preparation foranother world! that demands my authority for quitting this!--what mayhereafter--O terrible!--Pray for me, generous Miss Beverley!--kind,gentle Mr Arnott, pray for me!--Wretch as Mr Harrel appeared, without religion, principle, or honour,this incoherent letter, evidently written in the desperate moment ofdetermined suicide, very much affected both Cecilia and Mr Arnott, andin spite either of abhorrence or resentment, they mutually shed tearsover the address to themselves.Delvile, to whom every part of the affair was new, could only considerthese papers as so many specimens of guilt and infamy; he read them,therefore, with astonishment and detestation, and openly congratulatedCecilia upon having escaped the double snares that were spread for her.While this was passing, Mr Monckton arrived; who felt but littlesatisfaction from beholding the lady of his heart in confidentialdiscourse with two of his rivals, one of whom had long attacked herby the dangerous flattery of perseverance, and the other, without anyattack, had an influence yet more powerful.Delvile, having performed the office for which he came, concluded, uponthe entrance of Mr Monckton, that Cecilia had nothing further to wishfrom him; for her long acquaintance with that gentleman, his being amarried man, and her neighbour in the country, were circumstances wellknown to him; he merely, therefore, enquired if she would honour himwith any commands, and upon her assuring him she had none, he quietlywithdrew.This was no little relief to Mr Monckton, into whose hands Cecilia thenput the fatal packet; and while he was reading it, at the desire of MrArnott, she went up stairs to prepare Mrs Harrel for his admission.Mrs Harrel, unused to solitude, and as eager for company when unhappyto console, as when easy to divert her, consented to receive him withpleasure; they both wept at the meeting, and Cecilia, after some wordsof general comfort, left them together.She had then a very long and circumstantial conversation with MrMonckton, who explained whatever had appeared dark in the writingsleft by Mr Harrel, and who came to her before he saw them, with fullknowledge of what they contained.Mr Harrel had contracted with Sir Robert Floyer a large debt of honourbefore the arrival in town of Cecilia; and having no power to dischargeit, he promised that the prize he expected in his ward should fallto his share, upon condition that the debt was cancelled. Nothing wasthought more easy than to arrange this business, for the Baronet wasalways to be in her way, and the report of the intended alliance was tokeep off all other pretenders. Several times, however, her coldness madehim think the matter hopeless; and when he received her letter, hewould have given up the whole affair; but Mr Harrel, well knowing hisinability to satisfy the claims that would follow such a defection,constantly persuaded him the reserve was affected, and that his ownpride and want of assiduity occasioned all her discouragement.But while thus, by amusing the Baronet with false hopes, he kept off hisdemands, those of others were not less clamorous; his debts increased,his power of paying them diminished; he grew sour and desperate, and inone night lost £3000 beyond what he could produce, or offer any securityfor.This, as he said, was what he wished; and now he was, for the present,to extricate himself by doubling stakes and winning, or to force himselfinto suicide by doubling such a loss. For though, with tolerable ease,he could forget accounts innumerable with his tradesmen, one neglecteddebt of honour rendered his existence insupportable!For this last great effort, his difficulty was to raise the £3000already due, without which the proposal could not be made; and, aftervarious artifices and attempts, he at length contrived a meeting with MrMarriot, intreated him to lend him £2000 for only two days, and offeredhis warmest services in his favour with Cecilia.The rash and impassioned young man, deceived by his accounts intobelieving that his ward was wholly at his disposal, readily advanced themoney, without any other condition than that of leave to visit freelyat his house, to the exclusion of Sir Robert Floyer. ÒThe other £1000,Ó continued Mr Monckton, ÒI know not how he obtained, but he certainly hadthree. You, I hope, were not so unguarded--ÓÒAh, Mr Monckton,Ó said Cecilia, Òblame me not too severely! the attacksthat were made,--the necessity of otherwise betraying the worthy andhalf ruined Mr. Arnott--ÓÒOh fie,Ó cried he, Òto suffer your understanding to be lulled asleep,because the weak-minded Mr Arnott's could not be kept awake! I thought,after such cautions from me, and such experience of your own, you couldnot again have been thus duped.ÓÒI thought so too,Ó answered she, Òbut yet when the trial cameon,--indeed you know not how I was persecuted.ÓÒYet you see,Ó returned he, Òthe utter inutility of the attempt; yousee, and I told you beforehand, that nothing could save him.ÓÒTrue; but had I been firmer in refusal, I might not so well have knownit; I might then have upbraided myself with supposing that my compliancewould have rescued him.ÓÒYou have indeed,Ó cried Mr Monckton, Òfallen into most worthless hands,and the Dean was much to blame for naming so lightly a guardian to afortune such as yours.ÓÒPardon me,Ó cried Cecilia, Òhe never entrusted him with my fortune, hecommitted it wholly to Mr Briggs.ÓÒBut if he knew not the various subterfuges by which such a cautionmight be baffled, he ought to have taken advice of those who were betterinformed. Mr Briggs, too! what a wretch! mean, low, vulgar, sordid!--thewhole city of London, I believe, could not produce such another! howunaccountable to make you the ward of a man whose house you cannot enterwithout disgust!ÓÒHis house,Ó cried Cecilia, Òmy uncle never wished me to enter; hebelieved, and he was right, that my fortune would be safe in his hands;but for myself, he concluded I should always reside at Mr Harrel's.Ó ÒBut does not the city at this time,Ó said Mr Monckton, Òabound infamilies where, while your fortune was in security, you might yourselfhave lived with propriety? Nothing requires circumspection so minute asthe choice of a guardian to a girl of large fortune, and in general onething only is attended to, an appearance of property. Morals, integrity,character, are either not thought of, or investigated so superficially,that the enquiry were as well wholly omitted.Ó He then continued hisrelation.Mr Harrel hastened with his £3000 to the gaming table; one throw ofthe dice settled the business, he lost, and ought immediately to havedoubled the sum. That, however, was never more likely to be in hispower; he knew it; he knew, too, the joint claims of Cecilia's deceivedadmirers, and that his house was again threatened with executionsfrom various quarters;--he went home, loaded his pistols, and took themethods already related to work himself into courage for the deed.The means by which Mr Monckton had procured these particulars were manyand various, and not all such as he could avow; since in the course ofhis researches, he had tampered with servants and waiters, and scrupledat no methods that led but to discovery.Nor did his intelligence stop here; he had often, he said, wondered atthe patience of Mr Harrel's creditors, but now even that was clearedup by a fresh proof of infamy; he had been himself at the house inPortmansquare, where he was informed that Mr Harrel had kept them quiet,by repeated assurances that his ward, in a short time, meant to lend himmoney for discharging them all.Cecilia saw now but too clearly the reason her stay in his house was soimportant to him; and wondered less at his vehemence upon that subject,though she detested it more.ÒOh how little,Ó cried she, Òare the gay and the dissipated to beknown upon a short acquaintance! expensive, indeed, and thoughtlessand luxurious he appeared to me immediately; but fraudulent,base, designing, capable of every pernicious art of treachery andduplicity,--such, indeed, I expected not to find him, his veryflightiness and levity seemed incompatible with such hypocrisy.ÓÒHis flightiness,Ó said Mr Monckton, Òproceeded not from gaiety ofheart, it was merely the effect of effort; and his spirits were asmechanical as his taste for diversion. He had not strong parts, norwere his vices the result of his passions; had oeconomy been as much infashion as extravagance, he would have been equally eager to practiceit; he was a mere time-server, he struggled but to be something, andhaving neither talents nor sentiment to know what, he looked around himfor any pursuit, and seeing distinction was more easily attained in theroad to ruin than in any other, he gallopped along it, thoughtless ofbeing thrown when he came to the bottom, and sufficiently gratified inshewing his horsemanship by the way.ÓAnd now, all that he had either to hear or to communicate upon thissubject being told, he enquired, with a face strongly expressive of hisdisapprobation, why he found her at Mr Delvile's, and what had become ofher resolution to avoid his house?Cecilia, who, in the hurry of her mind and her affairs, had whollyforgotten that such a resolution had been taken, blushed at thequestion, and could not, at first, recollect what had urged her tobreak it; but when he proceeded to mention Mr Briggs, she was no longerdistressed; she gave a circumstantial account of her visit tohim, related the mean misery in which he lived, and told him theimpracticability of her residing in such a house.Mr Monckton could now in decency make no further opposition, howeverpainful and reluctant was his acquiescence; yet before he quittedher, he gave himself the consolation of considerably obliging her, andsoftened his chagrin by the sweetness of her acknowledgments.He enquired how much money in all she had now taken up of the Jew; andhearing it was £9050, he represented to her the additional loss shemust suffer by paying an exorbitant interest for so large a sum, andthe almost certainty with which she might be assured of very grossimposition; he expatiated, also, upon the injury which her charactermight receive in the world, were it known that she used such methodsto procure money, since the circumstances which had been her inducementwould probably either be unnoticed or misrepresented; and when he hadawakened in her much uneasiness and regret upon this subject, he offeredto pay the Jew without delay, clear her wholly from his power, andquietly receive the money when she came of age from herself.A proposal so truly friendly made her look upon the regard of MrMonckton in a higher and nobler point of view than her utmost esteem andreverence had hitherto placed it; yet she declined at first acceptingthe offer, from an apprehension it might occasion him inconvenience; butwhen he assured her he had a yet larger sum lying at present uselessin a Banker's hands, and promised to receive the same interest for hismoney he should be paid from the funds, she joyfully listened tohim; and it was settled that they should send for the Jew, take hisdischarge, and utterly dismiss him.Mr Monckton, however, fearful of appearing too officious in her affairs,wished not to have his part in the transaction published, and advisedCecilia not to reveal the matter to the Delviles. But great as was his[ascendancy] over her mind, her aversion to mystery and hypocrisy werestill greater; she would not, therefore, give him this promise, thoughher own desire to wait some seasonable opportunity for disclosing it,made her consent that their meeting with the Jew should be at the houseof Mrs Roberts in Fetter-lane, at twelve o'clock the next morning; whereshe might also see Mrs Hill and her children before she left town.They now parted, Cecilia charmed more than ever with her friend, whosekindness, as she suspected not his motives, seemed to spring from themost disinterested generosity.That, however, was the smallest feature in the character of Mr Monckton,who was entirely a man of the world, shrewd, penetrating, attentiveto his interest, and watchful of every advantage to improve it. In theservice he now did Cecilia, he was gratified by giving her pleasure, butthat was by no means his only gratification; he still hoped her fortunewould one day be his own, he was glad to transact any business withher, and happy in making her owe to him an obligation; but his principalinducement was yet stronger; he saw with much alarm the facility of herliberality; and he feared while she continued in correspondence withthe Jew, that the easiness with which she could raise money would be amotive with her to continue the practice whenever she was softened bydistress, or subdued by entreaty; but he hoped, by totally concludingthe negociation, the temptation would be removed; and that the hazardand inconvenience of renewing it, would strengthen her aversion to suchan expedient, till, between difficulties and disuse, that dangerousresource would be thought of no more.Cecilia then returned to Mrs Harrel, whom she found as she had left,weeping in the arms of her brother. They consulted upon what was bestto be done, and agreed that she ought instantly to leave town; for whichpurpose a chaise was ordered directly. They settled also that Mr Arnott,when he had conveyed her to his country house, which was in Suffolk,should hasten back to superintend the funeral, and see if anything couldbe saved from the creditors for his sister.Yet this plan, till Cecilia was summoned to dinner, they had not theresolution to put in practice. They were then obliged to be gone, andtheir parting was very melancholy. Mrs Harrel wept immoderately, andMr Arnott felt a concern too tender for avowal, though too sincerefor concealment. Cecilia, however glad to change her situation, wasextremely depressed by their sorrow, and entreated to have frequentaccounts of their proceedings, warmly repeating her offers of service,and protestations of faithful regard.She accompanied them to the chaise, and then went to the dining parlour,where she found Mr and Mrs Delvile, but saw nothing more of their sonthe whole day.The next morning after breakfast, Mrs Delvile set out upon someleave-taking visits, and Cecilia went in a chair to Fetter-lane; here,already waiting for her, she met the punctual Mr Monckton, and thedisappointed Jew, who most unwillingly was paid off, and relinquishedhis bonds; and who found in the severe and crafty Mr Monckton, anothersort of man to deal with than the necessitous and heedless Mr Harrel.As soon as he was dismissed, other bonds were drawn and signed, the oldones were destroyed; and Cecilia, to her infinite satisfaction, had nocreditor but Mr Monckton. Her bookseller, indeed, was still unpaid, buther debt with him was public, and gave her not any uneasiness.She now, with the warmest expressions of gratitude, took leave of MrMonckton, who suffered the most painful struggles in repressing thevarious apprehensions to which the parting, and her establishment at theDelviles gave rise.She then enquired briefly into the affairs of Mrs Hill, and having hearda satisfactory account of them, returned to St James's-square.BOOK VICHAPTER i. -- A DEBATE.It was still early, and Mrs Delvile was not expected till late. Cecilia,therefore, determined to make a visit to Miss Belfield, to whom she hadbeen denied during the late disorders at Mr Harrel's, and whom she couldnot endure to mortify by quitting town without seeing, since whateverwere her doubts about Delvile, of her she had none.To Portland-street, therefore, she ordered her chair, deliberatingas she went whether it were better to adhere to the reserve shehad hitherto maintained, or to satisfy her perplexity at once by aninvestigation into the truth. And still were these scruples undecided,when, looking in at the windows as she passed them to the door of thehouse, she perceived Miss Belfield standing in the parlour with a letterin her hand, which she was fervently pressing to her lips.Struck by this sight, a thousand painful conjectures occurred to her,all representing that the letter was from Delvile, and all explainingto his dishonour the mystery of his late conduct. And far were hersuspicions from diminishing, when, upon being shown into the parlour,Miss Belfield, trembling with her eagerness to hide it, hastily forcedthe letter into her pocket.Cecilia, surprised, dismayed, alarmed, stopt involuntarily at the door;but Miss Belfield, having secured what was so evidently precious to her,advanced, though not without blushing, and taking her hand, said ÒHowgood this is of you, madam, to come to me! when I did not know where tofind you, and when I was almost afraid I should have found you no more!ÓShe then told her, that the first news she had heard the precedingmorning, was the violent death of Mr Harrel, which had been related toher, with all its circumstances, by the landlord of their lodgings, whowas himself one of his principal creditors, and had immediately been atPortman-square to put in his claims; where he had learnt that all thefamily had quitted the house, which was entirely occupied by bailiffs.ÒAnd I was so sorry,Ó she continued, Òthat you should meet with anyhardships, and not know where to go, and have another home to seek, whenI am sure the commonest beggar would never want an habitation, if youhad one in your power to give him!--But how sad and melancholy you look!I am afraid this bad action of Mr Harrel has made you quite unhappy? Ahmadam! you are too good for this guilty world! your own compassion andbenevolence will not suffer you to rest in it!ÓCecilia, touched by this tender mistake of her present uneasiness,embraced her, and with much kindness, answered, ÒNo, sweet Henrietta! itis you who are good, who are innocent, who are guileless!--you, too, Ihope are happy!ÓÒAnd are not you, madam?Ó cried Henrietta, fondly returning her caress.ÒOh if you are not, who will ever deserve to be! I think I should ratherbe unhappy myself, than see you so; at least I am sure I ought, for thewhole world may be the better for your welfare, and as to me,--who wouldcare what became of me!ÓÒAh Henrietta!Ó cried Cecilia, Òdo you speak sincerely? do you indeedthink yourself so little valued?ÓÒWhy I don't say,Ó answered she, Òbut that I hope there are some whothink a little kindly of me, for if I had not that hope, I should wishto break my heart and die! but what is that to the love and reverence somany have for you?ÓÒSuppose,Ó said Cecilia, with a forced smile, ÒI should put your loveand reverence to the proof? do you think they would stand it?ÓÒO yes, indeed I do! and I have wished a thousand and a thousand timesthat I could but shew you my affection, and let you see that I did notlove you because you were a great lady, and high in the world, and fullof power to do me service, but because you were so good and so kind, sogentle to the unfortunate, and so sweet to every body!ÓÒHold, hold,Ó cried Cecilia, Òand let me try if indeed, fairly andtruly, you will answer what I mean to ask.ÓÒO yes,Ó cried she warmly, Òif it is the dearest secret I have in theworld! there is nothing I will not tell you; I will open my whole heartto you, and I shall be proud to think you will let me trust you, for Iam sure if you did not care a little for me, you would not take such atrouble.ÓÒYou are indeed a sweet creature!Ó said Cecilia, hesitating whether ornot to take advantage of her frankness, Òand every time I see you, Ilove you better. For the world would I not injure you,--and perhaps yourconfidence--I know not, indeed, if it is fair or right to exact it--Ó she stopt, extremely perplext, and while Henrietta waited her furtherenquiries, they were interrupted by the entrance of Mrs Belfield.ÒSure, Child,Ó cried she, to her daughter, Òyou might have let me knowbefore now who was here, when you knew so well how much I wished anopportunity to see the young lady myself; but here you come down uponpretence to see your brother, and then stay away all the morning, doingnobody knows what.Ó Then, turning to Cecilia, ÒMa'am,Ó she continued, ÒIhave been in the greatest concern in the world for the little accidentthat happened when I saw you before; for to be sure I thought, andindeed nobody will persuade me to the contrary, that it was rather anodd thing for such a young lady as you to come so often after Henny,without so much as thinking of any other reason; especially when, to besure, there's no more comparison between her and my son, than betweenanything in the world; however, if it is so, it is so, and I mean to sayno more about it, and to be sure he's as contented to think so as if hewas as mere an insignificant animal as could be.ÓÒThis matter, madam,Ó said Cecilia, Òhas so long been settled, that I amsorry you should trouble yourself to think of it again.ÓÒO, ma'am, I only mention it by the way of making the proper apology,for as to taking any other notice of it, I have quite left it off;though to be sure what I think I think; but as to my son, he has so gotthe upper hand of me, that it all goes for nothing, and I might justas well sing to him. Not that I mean to find fault with him neither; sopray, ma'am, don't let what I say be to his prejudice, for I believe allthe time, there's nobody like him, neither at this end of the town northe other; for as to the other, he has more the look of a lord, byhalf, than of a shopman, and the reason's plain, for that's the sort ofcompany he's always kept, as I daresay a lady such as you must have seenlong ago. But for all that, there's some little matters that we mothersfancy we can see into as well as our children; however, if they don'tthink so, why it answers no purpose to dispute; for as to a better son,to be sure there never was one, and that, as I always say, is the bestsign I know for making a good husband.ÓDuring this discourse, Henrietta was in the utmost confusion, dreadinglest the grossness of her mother should again send off Cecilia in anger;but Cecilia, who perceived her uneasiness, and who was more charmedwith her character than ever, from the simplicity of her sincerity,determined to save her that pain, by quietly hearing her harangue, andthen quietly departing; though she was much provoked to find from thecomplaining hints every instant thrown out, that Mrs Belfield wasstill internally convinced her son's obstinate bashfulness was the onlyobstacle to his chusing whom he pleased; and that though she no longerdared speak her opinion with openness, she was fully persuaded Ceciliawas at his service.ÒAnd for that reason,Ó continued Mrs Belfield, Òto be sure any lady thatknew her own true advantage, could do nothing better than to take therecommendation of a mother, who must naturally know more of her ownchildren's disposition than can be expected from a stranger; and as tosuch a son as mine, perhaps there a'n't two such in the world, for he'shad a gentleman's education, and turn him which way he will, he'll seenever a handsomer person than his own; though, poor dear love, he wasalways of the thinnest. But the misfortunes he's had to struggle withwould make nobody fatter.ÓHere she was interrupted, and Cecilia not a little surprised, by theentrance of Mr Hobson and Mr Simkins.ÒLadies,Ó cried Mr Hobson, whom she soon found was Mrs Belfield'slandlord; ÒI would not go up stairs without just stopping to let youknow a little how the world goes.ÓThen perceiving and recollecting Cecilia, he exclaimed ÒI am proud tosee you again, ma'am,--Miss, I believe I should say, for I take it youare too young a lady to be entered into matrimony yet.ÓÒMatrimony?Ó cried Mr Simkins, Òno, to be sure, Mr Hobson, how can yoube so out of the way? the young lady looks more like to a Miss from aboarding-school, if I might take the liberty for to say so.ÓÒAy, more's the pity,Ó cried Mrs Belfield, Òfor as to young ladieswaiting and waiting, I don't see the great good of it; especially if aproper match offers; for as to a good husband, I think no lady shouldbe above accepting him, if he's modest and well-behaved, and has beenbrought up with a genteel education.ÓÒWhy as to that, ma'am,Ó said Mr Simkins, Òit's another guess matter,for as to the lady's having a proper spouse, if I may be so free, Ithink as it's no bad thing.ÓCecilia now, taking Henrietta's hand, was wishing her good morning;but hearing Mr Hobson say he was just come from Portman-square, hercuriosity was excited, and she stayed a little longer.ÒSad work, ma'am,Ó said he; Òwho'd have thought Mr Harrel asked us allto supper for the mere purpose of such a thing as that! just to servefor a blind, as one may say. But when a man's conscience is foul, whatI say is it's ten to one but he makes away with himself. Let every mankeep clear of the world, that's my notion, and then he will be in nosuch hurry to get out of it.ÓÒWhy indeed, ma'am,Ó said Mr Simkins, advancing with many bows toCecilia, Òhumbly craving pardon for the liberty, I can't pretend for tosay I think Mr Harrel did quite the honourable thing by us; for as tohis making us drink all that champagne, and the like, it was a sheertake in, so that if I was to speak my mind, I can't say as I esteem itmuch of a favour.ÓÒWell,Ó said Mrs Belfield, Ònothing's to me so surprising as a person'sbeing his own executioner, for as to me, if I was to die for it fiftytimes, I don't think I could do it.ÓÒSo here,Ó resumed Mr Hobson, Òwe're all defrauded of our dues! nobody'sable to get his own, let him have worked for it ever so hard. Sad doingsin the square, Miss! all at sixes and sevens; for my part I came offfrom Vauxhall as soon as the thing had happened, hoping to get thestart of the others, or else I should have been proud to wait upon you,ladies, with the particulars; but a man of business never standsupon ceremony, for when money's at stake, that's out of the question.However, I was too late, for the house was seized before ever I couldget nigh it.ÓÒI hope, ma'am, if I may be so free,Ó said Mr Simkins, again profoundlybowing, Òthat you and the other lady did not take it much amiss my notcoming back to you, for it was not out of no disrespect, but only I gotso squeezed in by the ladies and gentlemen that was looking on, that Icould not make my way out, do what I could. But by what I see, I mustneeds say if one's never in such genteel company, people are alwaysrather of the rudest when one's in a crowd, for if one begs and praysnever so, there's no making 'em conformable.ÓÒPray,Ó said Cecilia, Òis it likely any thing will remain for MrsHarrel?ÓÒRemain, ma'am?Ó repeated Mr Hobson, ÒYes, a matter of a hundred billswithout a receipt to 'em! To be sure, ma'am, I don't want to affrontyou, that was his intimate acquaintance, more especially as you'vedone nothing disrespectful by me, which is more than I can say forMrs Harrel, who seemed downright ashamed of me, and of Mr Simkins too,though all things considered, it would have been as well for her not tohave been quite so high. But of that in its proper season!ÓÒFie, Mr Hobson fie,Ó cried the supple Mr Simkins, Òhow can you beso hard? for my share, I must needs own I think the poor lady's to bepitied; for it must have been but a melancholy sight to her, to see herspouse cut off so in the flower of his youth, as one may say; and youought to scorn to take exceptions at a lady's proudness when she's in somuch trouble. To be sure, I can't say myself as she was over-complaisantto make us welcome; but I hope I am above being so unpitiful as for toowe her a grudge for it now she's so down in the mouth.ÓÒLet everybody be civil!Ó cried Mr Hobson, Òthat's my notion; and then Ishall be as much above being unpitiful as anybody else.ÓÒMrs Harrel,Ó said Cecilia, Òwas then too unhappy, and is now, surely,too unfortunate, to make it possible any resentment should be harbouredagainst her.ÓÒYou speak, ma'am, like a lady of sense,Ó returned Mr Hobson, Òand,indeed, that's the character I hear of you; but for all that, ma'am,every body's willing to stand up for their own friends, for whichreason, ma'am, to be sure you'll be making the best of it, both for theRelict, and the late gentleman himself; but, ma'am, if I was to makebold to speak my mind in a fair manner, what I should say would be this;a man here to go shooting himself with all his debts unpaid, is a merepiece of scandal, ma'am! I beg pardon, but what I say is, the truth'sthe truth, and I can't call it by no other nomination.ÓCecilia now, finding she had not any chance of pacifying him, rang forher servant and chair.Mr Simkins then, affecting to lower his voice, said reproachfully to hisfriend ÒIndeed, Mr Hobson, to speak ingenusly, I must needs say I don'tthink it over and above pelite in you to be so hard upon the younglady's acquaintance that was, now he's defunct. To be sure I can'tpretend for to deny but he behaved rather comical; for not paying ofnobody, nor so much as making one a little compliment, or the like,though he made no bones of taking all one's goods, and always chused tohave the prime of every thing, why it's what I can't pretend to standup for. But that's neither here nor there, for if he had behaved as badagain, poor Miss could not tell how to help it; and I dares to say shehad no more hand in it than nobody at all.ÓÒNo, to be sure,Ó cried Mrs Belfield, Òwhat should she have to dowith it? Do you suppose a young lady of her fortune would want to takeadvantage of a person in trade? I am sure it would be both a shame anda sin if she did, for if she has not money enough, I wonder who has. Andfor my part, I think when a young lady has such a fine fortune as that,the only thing she has to do, is to be thinking of making a good useof it, by dividing it, as one may say, with a good husband. For asto keeping it all for herself, I dare say she's a lady of too muchgenerosity; and as to only marrying somebody that's got as much of hisown, why it is not half so much a favour; and if the young lady wouldtake my advice, she'd marry for love, for as to lucre, she's enough inall conscience.ÓÒAs to all that,Ó said Mr Hobson, Òit makes no alteration in myargument; I am speaking to the purpose, and not for the matter ofcomplaisance; and therefore I'm bold to say Mr Harrel's action hadnothing of the gentleman in it. A man has a right to his own life,you'll tell me; but what of that? that's no argument at all, for it doesnot give him a bit the more right to my property; and a man's running indebt, and spending other people's substances, for no reason in the worldbut just because he can blow out his own brains when he's done,--thoughit's a thing neither lawful nor religious to do,--why it's acting quiteout of character, and a great hardship to trade into the bargain.ÓÒI heartily wish it had been otherwise,Ó said Cecilia; Òbut I stillhope, if any thing can be done for Mrs Harrel, you will not object tosuch a proposal.ÓÒMa'am, as I said before,Ó returned Mr Hobson, ÒI see you're a lady ofsense, and for that I honour you; but as to any thing being done, it'swhat I call a distinct thing. What's mine is mine, and what's anotherman's is his; that's my way of arguing; but then if he takes what'smine, where's the law to hinder my taking what's his? This is what Icall talking to the purpose. Now as to a man's cutting his throat,or the like of that, for blowing out his own brains may be called theself-same thing, what are his creditors the better for that? nothingat all, but so much the worse it's a false notion to respect it, forthere's no respect in it; it's contrary to law, and a prejudice againstreligion.ÓÒI agree entirely in your opinion,Ó said Cecilia, Òbut still MrsHarrelÓ--ÒI know your argument, ma'am,Ó interrupted Mr Hobson; ÒMrs Harrel i'n'tthe worse for her husband's being shot through the head, because shewas no accessory to the same, and for that reason, it's a hardship sheshould lose all her substance; this, ma'am, is what I say, speaking toyour side of the argument. But now, ma'am, please to take notice what Iargue upon the reply; what have we creditors to do with a man's family?Suppose I am a cabinet-maker? When I send in my chairs, do I ask who isto sit upon them? No; it's all one to me whether it's the gentleman'sprogeny or his friends, I must be paid for the chairs the same, use themwho may. That's the law, ma'am, and no man need be ashamed to abide byit.ÓThe truth of this speech palliating its sententious absurdity, madeCecilia give up her faint attempt to soften him; and her chair beingready, she arose to take leave.ÒLack-a-day, ma'am,Ó cried Mrs Belfield, ÒI hope you won't go yet, for Iexpect my son home soon, and I've a heap of things to talk to you aboutbesides, only Mr Hobson having so much to say stopt my mouth. ButI should take it as a great favour, ma'am, if you would come someafternoon and drink a dish of tea with me, for then we should have timeto say all our say. And I'm sure, ma'am, if you would only let one ofyour footmen just take a run to let me know when you'd come, my sonwould be very proud to give you the meeting; and the servants can't havemuch else to do at your house, for where there's such a heap of 'em,they commonly think of nothing all day long but standing and gaping atone another.ÓÒI am going out of town to-morrow,Ó said Cecilia, Òand therefore cannothave the pleasure of calling upon Miss Belfield again.ÓShe then slightly courtsied, and left the room.The gentle Henrietta, her eyes swimming in tears, followed her to herchair; but she followed her not alone, Mrs Belfield also attended,repining very loudly at the unlucky absence of her son; and the cringingMr Simkins, creeping after her and bowing, said in a low voice, ÒIhumbly crave pardon, ma'am, for the liberty, but I hope you won't thinkas I have any share in Mr Hobson's behaving so rude, for I must needssay, I don't think it over genteel in no shape.Ó And Mr Hobson himself,bent upon having one more sentence heard, called out, even after shewas seated in her chair, ÒAll I say, ma'am, is this; let every man behonest; that's what I argue, and that's my notion of things.ÓCecilia still reached home before Mrs Delvile; but most uneasy were hersensations, and most unquiet was her heart; the letter she had seen inthe hands of Henrietta seemed to corroborate all her former suspicions,since if it came not from one infinitely dear to her she would nothave shewn such fondness for it, and if that one was not dear to her insecret, she would not have concealed it.Where then was the hope that any but Delvile could have written it? insecret she could not cherish two, and that Delvile was cherished mostfondly, the artlessness of her character unfitted her for disguising.And why should he write to her? what was his pretence? That he loved hershe could now less than ever believe, since his late conduct to herself,though perplexing and inconsistent, evinced at least a partialityincompatible with a passion for another. What then, could she infer, butthat he had seduced her affections, and ruined her peace, for the idleand cruel gratification of temporary vanity?ÒAnd if such,Ó cried she, Òis the depravity of this accomplishedhypocrite, if such is the littleness of soul that a manner so nobledisguises, shall be next, urged, perhaps, rather by prudence thanpreference, make me the object of his pursuit, and the food of hisvain-glory? And shall I, warned and instructed as I am, be as easy aprey and as wretched a dupe? No, I will be better satisfied with hisconduct, before I venture to trust him, and since I am richer thanHenrietta and less likely to be deserted, when won, I will be more on myguard to know why I am addressed, and vindicate the rights of innocence,if I find she has been thus deluded, by forgetting his talents in histreachery, and renouncing him for ever!ÓSuch were the reflections and surmises that dampt all the long-soughtpleasure of her change of residence, and made her habitation in StJames's-square no happier than it had been at Mr Harrel's!She dined again with only Mr and Mrs Delvile, and did not see their sonall day; which, in her present uncertainty what to think of him, was anabsence she scarcely regretted.When the servants retired, Mr Delvile told her that he had that morningreceived two visits upon her account, both from admirers, who eachpretended to having had leave to wait upon her from Mr Harrel.He then named Sir Robert Floyer and Mr Marriot.ÒI believe, indeed,Ó said Cecilia, Òthat neither of them were treatedperfectly well; to me, however, their own behaviour has by no meansbeen strictly honourable. I have always, when referred to, been veryexplicit; and what other methods they were pleased to take, I cannotwonder should fail.ÓÒI told them,Ó said Mr Delvile, Òthat, since you were now under my roof,I could not refuse to receive their proposals, especially as there wouldbe no impropriety in your alliance with either of them but I told them,at the same time, that I could by no means think of pressing their suit,as that was an office which, however well it might do for Mr Harrel,would be totally improper and unbecoming for me.ÓÒCertainly;Ó said Cecilia, Òand permit me, Sir, to entreat that, shouldthey again apply to you, they may be wholly discouraged from repeatingtheir visits, and assured that far from having trifled with themhitherto, the resolutions I have declared will never be varied.ÓÒI am happy,Ó said Mrs Delvile, Òto see so much spirit and discernmentwhere arts of all sorts will be practised to ensnare and delude. Fortuneand independence were never so securely lodged as in Miss Beverley, andI doubt not but her choice, whenever it is decided, will reflect asmuch honour upon her heart, as her difficulty in making it does upon herunderstanding.ÓMr Delvile then enquired whether she had fixed upon any person to chooseas a guardian in the place of Mr Harrel. No, she said, nor should she,unless it were absolutely necessary.ÒI believe, indeed,Ó said Mrs Delvile, Òyour affairs will not muchmiss him! Since I have heard of the excess of his extravagance, I haveextremely rejoiced in the uncommon prudence and sagacity of his fairward, who, in such dangerous hands, with less penetration and soundsense, might have been drawn into a thousand difficulties, and perhapsdefrauded of half her fortune.ÓCecilia received but little joy from this most unseasonable compliment,which, with many of the same sort that were frequently, thoughaccidentally made, intimidated her from the confession she had plannedand finding nothing but censure was likely to follow the discovery, sheat length determined to give it up wholly, unless any connection shouldtake place which might render necessary its avowal. Yet something shecould not but murmur, that an action so detrimental to her own interest,and which, at the time, appeared indispensable to her benevolence,should now be considered as a mark of such folly and imprudence that shedid not dare own it.CHAPTER ii. -- A RAILING.The next morning the family purposed setting off as soon as breakfastwas over; young Delvile, however, waited not so long; the fineness ofthe weather tempted him, he said, to travel on horse-back, and thereforehe had risen very early, and was already gone. Cecilia could not butwonder, yet did not repine.Just as breakfast was over, and Mr and Mrs Delvile and Cecilia werepreparing to depart, to their no little surprise, the door was opened,and, out of breath with haste and with heat, in stumpt Mr Briggs! ÒSo,Ó cried he to Cecilia, Òwhat's all this? hay?--where are you going?--acoach at the door! horses to every wheel! Servants fine as lords! what'sin the wind now? think to chouse me out of my belongings?ÓÒI thought, Sir,Ó said Cecilia, who instantly understood him, though Mrand Mrs Delvile stared at him in utter astonishment, ÒI had explainedbefore I left you that I should not return.ÓÒDidn't, didn't!Ó answered he, angrily; Òwaited for you three days,dressed a breast o' mutton o' purpose; got in a lobster, and two crabs;all spoilt by keeping; stink already; weather quite muggy, forced tosouse 'em in vinegar; one expense brings on another; never begin thelike agen.ÓÒI am very sorry, indeed,Ó said Cecilia, much disconcerted, Òifthere has been any mistake through my neglect; but I had hoped I wasunderstood, and I have been so much occupied--ÓÒAy, ay,Ó interrupted he, Òfine work! rare doings! a merry Vauxhalling,with pistols at all your noddles! thought as much! thought he'd tipthe perch; saw he wasn't stanch; knew he'd go by his company,--a set ofjackanapes! all blacklegs! nobody warm among 'em; fellows with a month'sgood living upon their backs, and not sixpence for the hangman in theirpockets!ÓMrs Delvile now, with a look of arch congratulation at Cecilia as theobject of this agreeable visit, finding it not likely to be immediatelyconcluded, returned to her chair; but Mr Delvile, leaning sternly uponhis cane, moved not from the spot where he stood at his entrance, butsurveyed him from head to foot, with the most astonished contempt at hisundaunted vulgarity.ÒWell I'd all your cash myself; seized that, else!--run out theconstable for you, next, and made you blow out your brains for company.Mind what I say, never give your mind to a gold lace hat! many a onewears it don't know five farthings from twopence. A good man alwayswears a bob wig; make that your rule. Ever see Master Harrel wear sucha thing? No, I'll warrant! better if he had; kept his head on his ownshoulders. And now, pray, how does he cut up? what has he left behindhim? a twey-case, I suppose, and a bit of a hat won't go on a man'shead!ÓCecilia, perceiving, with great confusion, that Mr Delvile, thoughevidently provoked by this intrusion, would not deign to speak, that MrBriggs might be regarded as belonging wholly to herself, hastily said ÒIwill not, Sir, as your time is precious, detain you here, but, as soonas it is in my power, I will wait upon you in the city.ÓMr Briggs, however, without listening to her, thought proper to continuehis harangue.ÒInvited me once to his house; sent me a card, half of it printed like abook! t'other half a scrawl could not read; pretended to give a supper;all a mere bam; went without my dinner, and got nothing to eat; allglass and shew; victuals painted all manner of colours; lighted up likea pastry-cook on twelfth-day; wanted something solid, and got a greatlump of sweetmeat; found it as cold as a stone, all froze in my mouthlike ice; made me jump again, and brought the tears in my eyes; forcedto spit it out; believe it was nothing but a snowball, just set up forshow, and covered over with a little sugar. Pretty way to spend money!Stuffing, and piping, and hopping! never could rest till every farthingwas gone; nothing left but his own fool's pate, and even that he couldnot hold together.ÓÒAt present, Sir,Ó said Cecilia, Òwe are all going out of town; thecarriage is waiting at the door, and therefore--ÓÒNo such thing,Ó cried he; ÒSha'n't go; come for you myself; take you tomy own house. Got every thing ready, been to the broker's, bought a niceblanket, hardly a brack in it. Pick up a table soon; one in my eye.ÓÒI am sorry you have so totally mistaken me, Sir; for I am now goinginto the country with Mr and Mrs Delvile.ÓÒWon't consent, won't consent! what will you go there for? hear ofnothing but dead dukes; as well visit an old tomb.ÓHere Mr Delvile, who felt himself insulted in a manner he could leastsupport, after looking at him very disdainfully, turned to Cecilia, andsaid ÒMiss Beverley, if this person wishes for a longer conference withyou, I am sorry you did not appoint a more seasonable hour for yourinterview.ÓÒAy, ay,Ó cried the impenetrable Mr Briggs; Òwant to hurry her off!see that! But 't won't do; a'n't to be nicked; chuse to come in for mythirds; won't be gulled, sha'n't have more than your share.ÓÒSir!Ó cried Mr Delvile, with a look meant to be nothing less thanpetrific.ÒWhat!Ó cried he, with an arch leer; Òall above it, hay? warrant yourSpanish Don never thinks of such a thing! don't believe 'em my duck!great cry and little wool; no more of the ready than other folks; merepuff and go one.ÓÒThis is language, Sir,Ó said Mr Delvile, Òso utterly incomprehensible,that I presume you do not even intend it should be understood;otherwise, I should very little scruple to inform you, that no man ofthe name of Delvile brooks the smallest insinuation of dishonour.ÓÒDon't he?Ó returned Mr Briggs, with a grin; Òwhy how will he help it?will the old grandees jump up out of their graves to frighten us?ÓÒWhat old grandees, Sir? to whom are you pleased to allude?ÓÒWhy all them old grandfathers and aunts you brag of; a set of poorsouls you won't let rest in their coffins; mere clay and dirt! finethings to be proud of! a parcel of old mouldy rubbish quite departedthis life! raking up bones and dust, nobody knows for what! ought to beashamed; who cares for dead carcases? nothing but [carrion]. My littleTom's worth forty of 'em!ÓÒI can so ill make out, Miss Beverley,Ó said the astonished Mr Delvile,Òwhat this person is pleased to dive at, that I cannot pretend to enterinto any sort of conversation with him; you will therefore be so goodas to let me know when he has finished his discourse, and you are atleisure to set off.ÓAnd then, with a very stately air, he was quitting the room; but wassoon stopt, upon Mr Briggs calling out ÒAy, ay, Don Duke, poke in theold charnel houses by yourself, none of your defunct for me! didn't careif they were all hung in a string. Who's the better for 'em?'ÒPray, Sir,Ó cried Mr Delvile, turning round, Òto whom were you pleasedto address that speech?ÓÒTo one Don Puffendorff,Ó replied Mr Briggs; Òknow ever such a person,hay?ÓÒDon who? Sir!Ó said Mr Delvile, stalking nearer to him, ÒI must troubleyou to say that name over again.ÓÒSuppose don't chuse it? how then?ÓÒI am to blame,Ó said Mr Delvile, scornfully waving his hand with arepulsive motion, Òto suffer myself to be irritated so unworthily; andI am sorry, in my own house, to be compelled to hint that the sooner Ihave it to myself, the better I shall be contented with it.ÓÒAy, ay, want to get me off; want to have her to yourself! won't be sosoon choused; who's the better man? hay? which do you think is warmest?and all got by myself; obliged to never a grandee for a penny; what doyou say to that? will you cast an account with me?ÓÒVery extraordinary this!Ó cried Mr Delvile; Òthe most extraordinarycircumstance of the kind I ever met with! a person to enter my house inorder to talk in this incomprehensible manner! a person, too, I hardlyknow by sight!ÓÒNever mind, old Don,Ó cried Briggs, with a facetious nod, ÒKnow mebetter another time!ÓÒOld who, Sir!--what!ÓÒCome to a fair reckoning,Ó continued Mr Briggs; Òsuppose you were in mycase, and had never a farthing but of your own getting; where wouldyou be then? What would become of your fine coach and horses? you mightstump your feet off before you'd ever get into one. Where would be allthis fine crockery work for your breakfast? you might pop your headunder a pump, or drink out of your own paw; what would you do for thatfine jemmy tye? Where would you get a gold head to your stick?--Youmight dig long enough in them cold vaults before any of your oldgrandfathers would pop out to give you one.ÓMr Delvile, feeling more enraged than he thought suited his dignity,restrained himself from making any further answer, but going up to thebell, rang it with great violence.ÒAnd as to ringing a bell,Ó continued Mr Briggs, Òyou'd never know whatit was in your life, unless could make interest to be a dust-man.ÓÒA dust-man!Ó--repeated Mr Delvile, unable to command his silencelonger, ÒI protestÓ--and biting his lips, he stopt short.ÒAy, love it, don't you? suits your taste; why not one dust as well asanother? Dust in a cart good as dust of a charnel-house; don't smellhalf so bad.ÓA servant now entering, Mr Delvile called out ÒIs everything ready?ÓÒYes, Sir.ÓHe then begged Mrs Delvile to go into the coach, and telling Cecilia tofollow when at leisure, left the room.ÒI will come immediately, Sir,Ó said Cecilia; ÒMr Briggs, I am sorryto leave you, and much concerned you have had this trouble; but I candetain Mr Delvile no longer.ÓAnd then away she ran, notwithstanding he repeatedly charged her tostay. He followed them, however, to the coach, with bitter revilingsthat every body was to make more of his ward than himself, and with themost virulent complaints of his losses from the blanket, the breast ofmutton, the crabs and the lobster!Nothing, however, more was said to him; Cecilia, as if she had not heardhim, only bowed her head, and the coach driving off, they soon lostsight of him.This incident by no means rendered the journey pleasant, or Mr Delvilegracious; his own dignity, that constant object of his thoughts and hiscares, had received a wound from this attack which he had not the senseto despise; and the vulgarity and impudence of Mr Briggs, which oughtto have made his familiarity and boldness equally contemptibleand ridiculous, served only with a man whose pride out-ran hisunderstanding, to render them doubly mortifying and stinging. He couldtalk, therefore, of nothing the whole way that they went, but theextreme impropriety of which the Dean of had been guilty, in exposinghim to scenes and situations so much beneath his rank, by leaguing himwith a person so coarse and disgraceful.They slept one night upon the road, and arrived the next day at DelvileCastle.CHAPTER iii. -- AN ANTIQUE MANSION.Delvile Castle was situated in a large and woody park, and surroundedby a moat. A drawbridge which fronted the entrance was every night, byorder of Mr Delvile, with the same care as if still necessary for thepreservation of the family, regularly drawn up. Some fortificationsstill remained entire, and vestiges were every where to be traced ofmore; no taste was shown in the disposition of the grounds, no openingswere contrived through the wood for distant views or beautiful objects;the mansion-house was ancient, large and magnificent, but constructedwith as little attention to convenience and comfort, as to airiness andelegance; it was dark, heavy and monastic, equally in want of repair andof improvement. The grandeur of its former inhabitants was every wherevisible, but the decay into which it was falling rendered such remainsmere objects for meditation and melancholy; while the evident struggleto support some appearance of its ancient dignity, made the dwellingand all in its vicinity wear an aspect of constraint and austerity.Festivity, joy and pleasure, seemed foreign to the purposes of itsconstruction; silence, solemnity and contemplation were adapted to itonly.Mrs Delvile, however, took all possible care to make the apartmentsand situation of Cecilia commodious and pleasant, and to banish byher kindness and animation the gloom and formality which her mansioninspired. Nor were her efforts ungratefully received; Cecilia, charmedby every mark of attention from a woman she so highly admired, returnedher solicitude by encreasing affection, and repaid all her care bythe revival of her spirits. She was happy, indeed, to have quitted thedisorderly house of Mr Harrel, where terror, so continually awakened,was only to be lulled by the grossest imposition; and though her mind,depressed by what was passed, and in suspence with what was to come, wasby no means in a state for uninterrupted enjoyment, yet to find herselfplaced, at last, without effort or impropriety, in the very mansionshe had so long considered as her road to happiness, rendered her,notwithstanding her remaining sources of inquietude, more contented thanshe had yet felt herself since her departure from Suffolk.Even the imperious Mr Delvile was more supportable here than in London;secure in his own castle, he looked around him with a pride of power andof possession which softened while it swelled him. His superiority wasundisputed, his will was without controul. He was not, as in the greatcapital of the kingdom, surrounded by competitors; no rivalry disturbedhis peace, no equality mortified his greatness; all he saw were eithervassals of his power, or guests bending to his pleasure; he abatedtherefore, considerably, the stern gloom of his haughtiness, and soothedhis proud mind by the courtesy of condescension.Little, however, was the opportunity Cecilia found, for evincing thatspirit and forbearance she had planned in relation to Delvile; hebreakfasted by himself every morning, rode or walked out alone tilldriven home by the heat of the day, and spent the rest of his time tilldinner in his own study. When he then appeared, his conversation wasalways general, and his attention not more engaged by Cecilia than byhis mother. Left by them with his father, sometimes he appeared again attea-time, but more commonly he rode or strolled out to some neighbouringfamily, and it was always uncertain whether he was again seen beforedinner the next day.By this conduct, reserve on her part was rendered totally unnecessary;she could give no discouragement where she met with no assiduity; shehad no occasion to fly where she was never pursued.Strange, however, she thought such behaviour, and utterly impossible tobe the effect of accident; his desire to avoid her seemed scrupulousand pointed, and however to the world it might wear the appearance ofchance, to her watchful anxiety a thousand circumstances marked it fordesign. She found that his friends at home had never seen so little ofhim, complaints were continually made of his frequent absences, and muchsurprise was expressed at his new manner of life, and what might be theoccupations which so strangely engrossed his time.Had her heart not interfered in this matter, she might now have beenperfectly at rest, since she was spared the renunciation she hadprojected, and since, without either mental exertion or personaltrouble, the affair seemed totally dropt, and Delvile, far frommanifesting any design of conquest, shunned all occasions of gallantry,and sedulously avoided even common conversation with her. If he saw herpreparing to walk out in an evening, he was certain to stay at home; ifhis mother was with her, and invited him to join them, he was sure to beready with some other engagement; and if by accident he met her in thepark, he merely stopt to speak of the weather, bowed, and hurried on.How to reconcile a coldness so extraordinary with a fervour so animatedas that which he had lately shewn, was indeed not easy; sometimes shefancied he had entangled not only the poor Henrietta but himself, atother times she believed him merely capricious; but that he studied toavoid her she was convinced invariably, and such a conviction was alonesufficient to determine her upon forwarding his purpose. And, when herfirst surprise was over, and first chagrin abated, her own pride came toher aid, and she resolved to use every method in her power to conquer apartiality so un gratefully bestowed. She rejoiced that in no instanceshe had ever betrayed it, and she saw that his own behaviourprevented all suspicion of it in the family. Yet, in the midst of hermortification and displeasure, she found some consolation in seeing thatthose mercenary views of which she had once been led to accuse him, werefarthest from his thoughts, and that whatever was the state of hismind, she had no artifice to apprehend, nor design to guard against. Alltherefore that remained was to imitate his example, be civil and formal,shun all interviews that were not public, and decline all discourse butwhat good breeding occasionally made necessary.By these means their meetings became more rare than ever, and of shorterduration, for if one by any accident was detained, the other retired;till, by their mutual diligence, they soon only saw each other atdinner; and though neither of them knew the motives or the intentions ofthe other, the best concerted agreement could not more effectually haveseparated them.This task to Cecilia was at first extremely painful; but time andconstancy of mind soon lessened its difficulty. She amused herself withwalking and reading, she commissioned Mr Monckton to send her a PianoForte of Merlin's, she was fond of fine work, and she found in theconversation of Mrs Delvile a never-failing resource against languorand sadness. Leaving therefore to himself her mysterious son, she wiselyresolved to find other employment for her thoughts, than conjectureswith which she could not be satisfied, and doubts that might never beexplained.Very few families visited at the castle, and fewer still had theirvisits returned. The arrogance of Mr Delvile had offended all theneighbouring gentry, who could easily be better entertained than byreceiving instructions of their own inferiority, which however readilythey might allow, was by no means so pleasant a subject as to recompensethem for hearing no other. And if Mr Delvile was shunned through hatred,his lady no less was avoided through fear; high-spirited and fastidious,she was easily wearied and disgusted, she bore neither with frailty norfolly--those two principal ingredients in human nature! She required,to obtain her favour, the union of virtue and abilities with elegance,which meeting but rarely, she was rarely disposed to be pleased; anddisdaining to conceal either contempt or aversion, she inspired inreturn nothing but dread or resentment; making thus, by a want of thatlenity which is the milk of human kindness, and the bond of society,enemies the most numerous and illiberal by those very talents which,more meekly borne, would have rendered her not merely admired, butadored!In proportion, however, as she was thus at war with the world ingeneral, the chosen few who were honoured with her favour, she lovedwith a zeal all her own; her heart, liberal, open, and but too daringlysincere, was fervent in affection, and enthusiastic in admiration; thefriends who were dear to her, she was devoted to serve, she magnifiedtheir virtues till she thought them of an higher race of beings, sheinflamed her generosity with ideas of what she owed to them, till herlife seemed too small a sacrifice to be refused for their service.Such was the love which already she felt for Cecilia; her countenancehad struck, her manners had charmed her, her understanding was displayedby the quick intelligence of her eyes, and every action and every notionspoke her mind the seat of elegance. In secret she sometimes regrettedthat she was not higher born, but that regret always vanished when shesaw and conversed with her.Her own youth had been passed in all the severity of affliction; she hadbeen married to Mr Delvile by her relations, without any consultation ofher heart or her will. Her strong mind disdained useless complaints, yether discontent, however private, was deep. Ardent in her disposition,and naturally violent in her passions, her feelings were extremelyacute, and to curb them by reason and principle had been the chief andhard study of her life. The effort had calmed, though it had not madeher happy. To love Mr Delvile she felt was impossible; proud withoutmerit, and imperious without capacity, she saw with bitterness theinferiority of his faculties, and she found in his temper no qualitiesto endear or attract; yet she respected his birth and his family,of which her own was a branch, and whatever was her misery from theconnection, she steadily behaved to him with the strictest propriety.Her son, however, when she was blessed with his presence, had a powerover her mind that mitigated all her sorrows, and almost lulled even herwishes to sleep; she rather idolised than loved him, yet her fondnessflowed not from relationship, but from his worth and his character, histalents and his disposition. She saw in him, indeed, all her own virtuesand excellencies, with a toleration for the imperfections of others towhich she was wholly a stranger. Whatever was great or good she expectedhim to perform; occasion alone she thought wanting to manifest him thefirst of human beings.Nor here was Mr Delvile himself less sanguine in his hopes; his son wasnot only the first object of his affection, but the chief idol of hispride, and he did not merely cherish but reverence him as his successor,the only support of his ancient name and family, without whose lifeand health the whole race would be extinct. He consulted him in allhis affairs, never mentioned him but with distinction, and expected thewhole world to bow down before him.Delvile in his behaviour to his father imitated the conduct of hismother, who opposed him in nothing when his pleasure was made known, butwho forbore to enquire into his opinion except in cases of necessity.Their minds, indeed, were totally dissimilar; and Delvile well knew thatif he submitted to his directions, he must demand such respect as theworld would refuse with indignation, and scarcely speak to a man whosegenealogy was not known to him.But though duty and gratitude were the only ties that bound him to hisfather, he loved his mother not merely with filial affection, butwith the purest esteem and highest reverence; he knew, too, that whilewithout him her existence would be a burthen, her tenderness was noeffusion of weak partiality, but founded on the strongest assurances ofhis worth; and however to maternal indulgence its origin might be owing,the rectitude of his own conduct could alone save it from diminution.Such was the house in which Cecilia was now settled, and with which shelived almost to the exclusion of the sight of any other; for though shehad now been three weeks at the castle, she had only at church seen anyfamily but the Delviles.Nor did any thing in the course of that time occur to her, but thereception of a melancholy letter from Mrs Harrel, filled with complaintsof her retirement and misery; and another, from Mr Arnott, with anaccount of the funeral, the difficulties he had had to encounter withthe creditors, who had even seized the dead body, and the numerousexpences in which he had been involved, by petitions he could notwithstand, from the meaner and more clamorous of those whom his latebrother-in-law had left unpaid. He concluded with a pathetic prayer forher happiness, and a declaration that his own was lost for ever, sincenow he was even deprived of her sight. Cecilia wrote an affectionateanswer to Mrs Harrel, promising, when fully at liberty, that she wouldherself fetch her to her own house in Suffolk; but she could only sendher compliments to Mr Arnott, though her compassion urged a kindermessage; as she feared even a shadow of encouragement to so serious, yethopeless a passion.CHAPTER iv. -- A RATTLE.At this time, the house was much enlivened by a visit from Lady HonoriaPemberton, who came to spend a month with Mrs Delvile.Cecilia had now but little leisure, for Lady Honoria would hardly resta moment away from her; she insisted upon walking with her, sitting withher, working with her, and singing with her; whatever she did, she choseto do also; wherever she went, she was bent upon accompanying her; andMrs Delvile, who wished her well, though she had no patience with herfoibles, encouraged this intimacy from the hope it might do her service.It was not, however, that Lady Honoria had conceived any regard forCecilia; on the contrary, had she been told she should see her no more,she would have heard it with the same composure as if she had been toldshe should meet with her daily; she had no motive for pursuing her butthat she had nothing else to do, and no fondness for her society but,what resulted from aversion to solitude.Lady Honoria had received a fashionable education, in which herproficiency had been equal to what fashion made requisite; she sunga little; played the harpsichord a little, painted a little, worked alittle, and danced a great deal. She had quick parts and high spirits,though her mind was uncultivated, and she was totally void of judgmentor discretion; she was careless of giving offence, and indifferentto all that was thought of her; the delight of her life was to createwonder by her rattle, and whether that wonder was to her advantage ordiscredit, she did not for a moment trouble herself to consider.A character of so much levity with so little heart had no great chanceof raising esteem or regard in Cecilia, who at almost any other periodof her life would have been wearied of her importunate attendance; butat present, the unsettled state of her own mind made her glad to give itany employment, and the sprightliness of Lady Honoria served thereforeto amuse her. Yet she could not forbear being hurt by finding that thebehaviour of Delvile was so exactly the same to them both, thatany common observer would with difficulty have pronounced which hepreferred.One morning about a week after her ladyship's arrival at the castle, shecame running into Cecilia's room, saying she had very good news for her.ÒA charming opening!Ó cried Cecilia, Òpray tell it me.ÓÒWhy my Lord Derford is coming!ÓÒO what a melancholy dearth of incident,Ó cried Cecilia, Òif this isyour best intelligence!ÓÒWhy it's better than nothing; better than going to sleep over a familyparty; and I vow I have sometimes such difficulty to keep awake, thatI am frightened to death lest I should be taken with a sudden nap, andaffront them all. Now pray speak the truth without squeamishness, don'tyou find it very terrible?ÓÒNo, I find nothing very terrible with Mrs Delvile.ÓÒO, I like Mrs Delvile, too, of all things, for I believe she's thecleverest woman in the world; but then I know she does not like me, sothere's no being very fond of her. Besides, really, if I admired her asmuch again, I should be, dreadfully tired of seeing nothing else. Shenever stirs out, you know, and has no company at home, which is anextremely tiresome plan, for it only serves to make us all doubly sickof one another; though you must know it's one great reason why my fatherlikes I should come; for he has some very old-fashioned notions, thoughI take a great deal of pains to make him get the better of them. But Iam always excessively rejoiced when the visit has been paid, for I amobliged to come every year. I don't mean now, indeed, because your beinghere makes it vastly more tolerable.ÓÒYou do me much honour,Ó cried Cecilia, laughing.ÒBut really, when my Lord Derford comes, it can't possibly be quite sobad, for at least there will be something else to look at; and you mustknow my eyes tire extremely of always seeing the same objects. And wecan ask him, too, for a little news, and that will put Mrs Delvile ina passion, which will help to give us a little spirit; though I know weshall not get the smallest intelligence from him, for he knows nothingin the world that's going forward. And, indeed, that's no great matter,for if he did, he would not know how to tell it, he's so excessivelysilly. However, I shall ask him all sort of things, for the less hecan answer, the more it will plague him; and I like to plague a foolamazingly, because he can never plague one again.--Though really I oughtto beg your pardon, for he is one of your admirers.ÓÒOh pray make no stranger of me! you have my free consent to saywhatever you please of him.ÓÒI assure you, then, I like my old Lord Ernolf the best of the two,for he has a thousand times more sense than his son, and upon my word Idon't think he is much uglier. But I wonder vastly you would not marryhim, for all that, for you might have done exactly what you pleased withhim, which, altogether, would have been no inconvenient circumstance.ÓÒWhen I want a pupil,Ó answered Cecilia, ÒI shall think that anadmirable recommendation; but were I to marry, I would rather find atutor, of the two.ÓÒI am sure I should not,Ó cried Lady Honoria, carelessly, Òfor onehas enough to do with tutors before hand, and the best thing I know ofmarrying is to get rid of them. I fancy you think so too, only it's apretty speech to make. Oh how my sister Euphrasia would adore you!--Prayare you always as grave as you are now?ÓÒNo,--yes,--indeed I hardly know.ÓÒI fancy it's this dismal place that hurts your spirits. I remember whenI saw you in St James's-square I thought you very lively. But reallythese thick walls are enough to inspire the vapours if one never hadthem before.ÓÒI don't think they have had a very bad effect upon your ladyship!ÓÒO yes they have; if Euphrasia was here she would hardly know me. Andthe extreme want of taste and entertainment in all the family is quitemelancholy; for even if by chance one has the good fortune to hear anyintelligence, Mrs Delvile will hardly let it be repeated, for fear itshould happen to be untrue, as if that could possibly signify! I am sureI had as lieve the things were false as not, for they tell as well oneway as the other, if she would but have patience to hear them. But she'sextremely severe, you know, as almost all those very clever women are;so that she keeps a kind of restraint upon me whether I will or no.However, that's nothing compared to her caro sposo, for he is utterlyinsufferable; so solemn, and so dull! so stately and so tiresome!Mortimer, too, gets worse and worse; O 'tis a sad tribe! I dare say hewill soon grow quite as horrible as his father. Don't you think so?ÓÒWhy indeed,--no,--I don't think there's much resemblance,Ó saidCecilia, with some hesitation.ÒHe is the most altered creature,Ó continued her ladyship, ÒI eversaw in my life. Once I thought him the most agreeable young man in theworld; but if you observe, that's all over now, and he is getting justas stupid and dismal as the rest of them. I wish you had been here lastsummer; I assure you, you would quite have fallen in love with him.ÓÒShould I?Ó said Cecilia, with a conscious smile.ÒYes, for he was quite delightful; all spirit and gaiety, but now, ifit was not for you, I really think I should pretend to lose my way, andinstead of going over that old draw-bridge, throw myself into the moat.I wish Euphrasia was here. It's just the right place for her. She'llfancy herself in a monastery as soon as she comes, and nothing will makeher half so happy, for she is always wishing to be a Nun, poor littlesimpleton.ÒIs there any chance that Lady Euphrasia may come?ÓÒO no, she can't at present, because it would not be proper; but I meanif ever she is married to Mortimer.ÓÒMarried to him!Ó repeated Cecilia, in the utmost consternation.ÒI believe, my dear,Ó cried Lady Honoria, looking at her very archly,Òyou intend to be married to him yourself?ÓÒMe? no, indeed!ÓÒYou look very guilty, though,Ó cried she laughing, Òand indeed when youcame hither, every body said that the whole affair was arranged.ÓÒFor shame, Lady Honoria!Ó said Cecilia, again changing colour, ÒI amsure this must be your own fancy,--invention,--ÓÒNo, I assure you; I heard it at several places; and every body said howcharmingly your fortune would build up all these old fortifications;but some people said they knew Mr Harrel had sold you to Mr Marriot, andthat if you married Mortimer, there would be a lawsuit that would takeaway half your estate; and others said you had promised your hand to SirRobert Floyer, and repented when you heard of his mortgages, and he gaveit out every where that he would fight any man that pretended to you;and then again some said that you were all the time privately married toMr Arnott, but did not dare own it, because he was so afraid of fightingwith Sir Robert.ÓÒO Lady Honoria!Ó cried Cecilia, half laughing, Òwhat wild inventionsare these! and all I hope, your own?ÓÒNo, indeed, they were current over the whole town. But don't take anynotice of what I told you about Euphrasia, for perhaps, it may neverhappen.ÓÒPerhaps,Ó said Cecilia, reviving by believing it all fiction, Òit hasnever been in agitation?ÓÒO yes; it is negociating at this very moment, I believe, among thehigher powers; only Mr Delvile does not yet know whether Euphrasia hasfortune enough for what he wants.ÓAh, thought Cecilia, how do I rejoice that my independent situationexempts me from being disposed of for life, by thus being set up tosale!ÒThey thought of me, once, for Mortimer,Ó continued Lady Honoria, ÒbutI'm vastly glad that's over, for I never should have survived being shutup in this place; it's much fitter for Euphrasia. To tell you the truth,I believe they could not make out money enough; but Euphrasia has afortune of her own, besides what we shall have together, for Grandmamaleft her every thing that was in her own power.ÓÒIs Lady Euphrasia your elder sister?ÓÒO no, poor little thing, she's two years younger. Grandmama broughther up, and` she has seen nothing at all of the world, for she has neverbeen presented yet, so she is not come out, you know; but she's to comeout next year. However, she once saw Mortimer, but she did not like himat all.ÓÒNot like him!Ó cried Cecilia, greatly surprised.ÒNo, she thought him too gay,--Oh dear, I wish she could see him now!I am sure I hope she would find him sad enough! she is the most formallittle grave thing you ever beheld; she'll preach to you sometimes forhalf an hour together. Grandmama taught her nothing in the world but tosay her prayers, so that almost every other word you say, she thinks isquite wicked.ÓThe conversation was now interrupted by their separating to dress fordinner. It left Cecilia in much perplexity; she knew not what wholly tocredit, or wholly to disbelieve; but her chief concern arose from theunfortunate change of countenance which Lady Honoria had been so quickin observing.The next time she was alone with Mrs Delvile, ÒMiss Beverley,Ó she said,Òhas your little rattling tormentor acquainted you who is coming?ÓÒLord Derford, do you mean, ma'am?ÓÒYes, with his father; shall you dislike to see them?ÓÒNot if, as I hope, they come merely to wait upon you and Mr Delvile.ÓÒMr Delvile and myself,Ó answered she smiling, Òwill certainly have thehonour of receiving them.ÓÒLord Ernolf,Ó said Cecilia, Òcan never suppose his visit will make anychange in me; I have been very explicit with him, and he seemed equallyrational and well bred in forbearing any importunity upon the subject.ÓÒIt has however been much believed in town,Ó said Mrs Delvile, Òthatyou were strangely shackled by Mr Harrel, and therefore his lordshipmay probably hope that a change in your situation may be followed by achange in his favour.ÓÒI shall be sorry if he does,Ó said Cecilia, Òfor he will then findhimself much deceived.ÓÒYou are right, very right,Ó cried Mrs Delvile, Òto be difficult in yourchoice, and to take time for looking around you before you make any. Ihave forborn all questions upon this subject, lest you should find anyreluctance in answering them; but I am now too deeply interested in yourwelfare to be contented in total ignorance of your designs; will you,then, suffer me to make a few enquiries?ÓCecilia gave a ready, but blushing assent.ÒTell me, then, of the many admirers who have graced your train,which there is you have distinguished with any intention of futurepreference?ÓÒNot one, madam!ÓÒAnd, out of so many, is there not one that, hereafter, you mean todistinguish?ÓÒAh madam!Ó cried Cecilia, shaking her head, Òmany as they may seem, Ihave little reason to be proud of them; there is one only who, had myfortune been smaller, would, I believe, ever have thought of me, andthere is one only, who, were it now diminished, would ever think of memore.ÓÒThis sincerity,Ó cried Mrs Delvile, Òis just what I expected from you.There is, then, one?ÓÒI believe there is,--and the worthy Mr Arnott is the man; I am muchindeed deceived, if his partiality for me is not truly disinterested,and I almost wishÓ--ÒWhat, my love?ÓÒThat I could return it more gratefully!ÓÒAnd do you not?ÓÒNo!--I cannot! I esteem him, I have the truest regard for hischaracter, and were I now by any fatal necessity, compelled to belongto any one of those who have been pleased to address me, I should nothesitate a moment in shewing him my gratitude; but yet, for some time atleast, such a proof of it would render me very miserable.ÓÒYou may perhaps think so now,Ó returned Mrs Delvile; Òbut withsentiments so strongly in his favour, you will probably be led hereafterto pity--and accept him.ÓÒNo, indeed, madam; I pretend not, I own, to open my whole heart toyou;--I know not that you would have patience, for so uninteresting adetail; but though there are some things I venture not to mention, thereis nothing, believe me, in which I will deceive you.ÓÒI do believe you,Ó cried Mrs Delvile, embracing her; Òand the morereadily because, not merely among your avowed admirers, but among thewhole race of men, I scarce know one to whom I should think you worthilyconsigned!ÓAh! thought Cecilia, that scarce! who may it mean to except?ÒTo shew you,Ó she continued, Òthat I will deserve your confidence infuture, I will refrain from distressing you by any further questions atpresent; you will not, I think, act materially without consulting me,and for your thoughts--it were tyranny, not friendship, to investigatethem more narrowly.ÓCecilia's gratitude for this delicacy, would instantly have inducedher to tell every secret of her soul, had she not apprehended such aconfession would have seemed soliciting her interest and assistance, inthe only affair in which she would have disdained even to receive them.She thanked her, therefore, for her kindness, and the conversation wasdropt; she much wished to have known whether these enquiries sprungsimply from friendly curiosity, or whether she was desirous fromany nearer motive to be satisfied with respect to her freedom orengagements. This, however, she had no method of discovering, and wastherefore compelled to wait quietly till time should make it clear.CHAPTER v. -- A STORM.One evening about this time, which was the latter end of July, LadyHonoria and Cecilia deferred walking out till very late, and then foundit so pleasant, that they had strolled into the Park two miles from thehouse, when they were met by young Delvile; who, however, only remindedthem how far they had to return, and walked on.ÒHe grows quite intolerable!Ó cried Lady Honoria, when he was gone;Òit's really a melancholy thing to see a young man behave so like an oldMonk. I dare say in another week he won't take off his hat to us; and,in about a fortnight, I suppose he'll shut himself up in one of thoselittle round towers, and shave his head, and live upon roots, and howlif any body comes near him. I really half wonder he does not think ittoo dissipated to let Fidel run after him so. A thousand to one but heshoots him some day for giving a sudden bark when he's in one of thesegloomy fits. Something, however, must certainly be the matter with him.Perhaps he is in love.ÓÒCan nothing be the matter with him but that?Ó cried Cecilia.ÒNay, I don't know; but I am sure if he is, his Mistress has not muchoccasion to be jealous of you or me, for never, I think, were two poorDamsels so neglected!ÓThe utmost art of malice could not have furnished speech more trulymortifying to Cecilia than this thoughtless and accidental sally of LadyHonoria's; particularly, however, upon her guard, from the raillery shehad already endured, she answered, with apparent indifference, Òhe ismeditating, perhaps, upon Lady Euphrasia.ÓÒO no,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òfor he did not take any notice of her whenhe saw her; I am sure if he marries her, it will only be because hecannot help it.ÓÒPoor Lady Euphrasia!ÓÒO no, not at all; he'll make her two or three fine speeches, and thenshe'll be perfectly contented especially if he looks as dismally at heras he does at us! and that probably he will do the more readily for notliking to look at her at all. But she's such a romantic little thing,she'll never suspect him.ÓHere they were somewhat alarmed by a sudden darkness in the air, whichwas presently succeeded by a thunder storm; they instantly turned back,and began running home, when a violent shower of rain obliged them totake shelter under a large tree; where in two minutes they were joinedby Delvile, who came to offer his assistance in hurrying them home; andfinding the thunder and lightning continue, begged them to move on, indefiance of the rain, as their present situation exposed them to moredanger than a wet hat and cloak, which might be changed in a moment.Cecilia readily assented; but Lady Honoria, extremely frightened,protested she would not stir till the storm was over. It was in vain herepresented her mistake in supposing herself in a place of security; sheclung to the tree, screamed at every flash of lightning, and all her gayspirits were lost in her apprehensions.Delvile then earnestly proposed to Cecilia conducting her home byherself, and returning again to Lady Honoria; but she thought itwrong to quit her companion, and hardly right to accept his assistanceseparately. They waited, therefore, some time all together; but thestorm increasing with great violence, the thunder growing louder, andthe lightning becoming stronger, Delvile grew impatient even to angerat Lady Honoria's resistance, and warmly expostulated upon its follyand danger. But the present was no season for lessons in philosophy;prejudices she had never been taught to surmount made her think herselfin a place of safety, and she was now too much terrified to giveargument fair play.Finding her thus impracticable, Delvile eagerly said to Cecilia, ÒComethen, Miss Beverley, let us wait no longer; I will see you home, andthen return to Lady Honoria.ÓÒBy no means,Ó cried she, Òmy life is not more precious than either ofyours, and therefore it may run the same risk.ÓÒIt is more precious,Ó cried he with vehemence, Òthan the air Ibreathe!Ó and seizing her hand, he drew it under his arm, and, withoutwaiting her consent, almost forced her away with him, saying as theyran, ÒHow could a thousand Lady Honoria's recompense the world for theloss of one Miss Beverley? we may, indeed, find many thousand suchas Lady Honoria, but such as Miss Beverley--where shall we ever findanother?ÓCecilia, surprised, yet gratified, could not speak, for the speed withwhich they ran almost took away her breath; and before they were nearhome, slackening her pace, and panting, she confessed her strength wasexhausted, and that she could go so fast no further.ÒLet us then stop and rest,Ó cried he; Òbut why will you not lean uponme? surely this is no time for scruples, and for idle and unnecessaryscruples, Miss Beverley can never find a time.ÓCecilia then, urged equally by shame at his speech and by weakness fromfatigue, leant upon his arm but she soon repented her condescension;for Delvile, with an emotion he seemed to find wholly irrepressible,passionately exclaimed Òsweet lovely burthen! O why not thus for ever!ÓThe strength of Cecilia was now instantly restored, and she hastilywithdrew from his hold; he suffered her to disengage herself, but saidin a faultering voice, Òpardon me, Cecilia!--Madam!--Miss Beverley, Imean!--ÓCecilia, without making any answer, walked on by herself, as quick apace as she was able; and Delvile, not venturing to oppose her, silentlyfollowed.They had gone but a few steps, before there came a violent shower ofhail; and the wind, which was very high, being immediately in theirfaces, Cecilia was so pelted and incommoded, that she was frequentlyobliged to stop, in defiance of her utmost efforts to force herselfforward. Delvile then approaching her, proposed that she should againstand under a tree, as the thunder and lightning for the present seemedover, and wait there till the fury of the hail was past; and Cecilia,though never before so little disposed to oblige him, was so muchdistressed by the violence of the wind and hail, that she was forced tocomply.Every instant now seemed an age; yet neither hail nor wind abated; meantime they were both silent, and both, though with different feelings,equally comfortless.Delvile, however, who took care to place himself on the side whence thewind blew hardest, perceived, in spite of his endeavours to save her,some hail-stones lodged upon her thin summer cloak; he then took offhis own hat, and, though he ventured not to let it touch her, held it insuch a manner as to shelter her better.Cecilia now could no longer be either silent or unmoved, but turning tohim with much emotion, said, ÒWhy will you do this, Mr Delvile?ÓÒWhat would I not do,Ó answered he, Òto obtain forgiveness from MissBeverley?ÓÒWell, well,--pray put on your hat.ÓÒDo you command it?ÓÒNo, certainly!--but I wish it.ÓÒAh!Ó cried he, instantly putting it on, Òwhose are the commands thatwould have half the weight with your wishes?ÓAnd then, after another pause, he added, Òdo you forgive me?ÓCecilia, ashamed of the cause of their dissension, and softened by theseriousness of his manner, answered very readily, Òyes, yes,--why willyou make me remember such nonsense?ÓÒAll sweetness,Ó cried he warmly, and snatching her hand, Òis MissBeverley!--O that I had power--that it were not utterly impossible--thatthe cruelty of my situation--ÓÒI find,Ó cried she, greatly agitated, and forcibly drawing away herhand, Òyou will teach me, for another time, the folly of fearing badweather!ÓAnd she hurried from beneath the tree; and Delvile perceiving one of theservants approach with an umbrella, went forward to take it from him,and directed him to hasten instantly to Lady Honoria.Then returning to Cecilia, he would have held it over her head, but withan air of displeasure, she took it into her own hand.ÒWill you not let me carry it for you?Ó he cried.ÒNo, Sir, there is not any occasion.ÓThey then proceeded silently on.The storm was now soon over; but it grew very dark, and as they hadquitted the path while they ran, in order to get home by a shorter cut,the walk was so bad from the height of the grass, and the unevenness ofthe ground, that Cecilia had the utmost difficulty to make her way; yetshe resolutely refused any assistance from Delvile, who walked anxiouslyby her side, and seemed equally fearful upon his own account and uponhers, to trust himself with being importunate.At length they came to a place which Cecilia in vain tried to pass;Delvile then grew more urgent to help her; firm, however, in decliningall aid, she preferred going a considerable way round to another partof the park which led to the house. Delvile, angry as well as mortified,proposed to assist her no more, but followed without saying a word.Cecilia, though she felt not all the resentment she displayed, stillthought it necessary to support it, as she was much provoked with theperpetual inconsistency of his behaviour, and deemed it wholly improperto suffer, without discouragement, occasional sallies of tendernessfrom one who, in his general conduct, behaved with the most scrupulousreserve.They now arrived at the castle; but entering by a back way, came to asmall and narrow passage which obstructed the entrance of the umbrella;Delvile once more, and almost involuntarily, offered to help her; but,letting down the spring, she coldly said she had no further use for it.He then went forward to open a small gate which led by another longpassage into the hall; but hearing the servants advance, he held it foran instant in his hand, while, in a tone of voice the most dejected, hesaid ÒI am grieved to find you thus offended; but were it possible youcould know half the wretchedness of my heart, the generosity of yourown would make you regret this severity!Ó and then, opening the gate, hebowed, and went another way.Cecilia was now in the midst of servants; but so much shocked andastonished by the unexpected speech of Delvile, which instantly changedall her anger into sorrow, that she scarce knew what they said to her,nor what she replied; though they all with one voice enquired what wasbecome of Lady Honoria, and which way they should run to seek her.Mrs Delvile then came also, and she was obliged to recollect herself.She immediately proposed her going to bed, and drinking white wine wheyto prevent taking cold; cold, indeed, she feared not; yet she agreed tothe proposal, for she was confounded and dismayed by what had passed,and utterly unable to hold any conversation.Her perplexity and distress were, however, all attributed to fatigue andfright; and Mrs Delvile, having assisted in hurrying her to bed, went toperform the same office for Lady Honoria, who arrived at that time.Left at length by herself, she revolved in her mind the adventure ofthe evening, and the whole behaviour of Delvile since first she wasacquainted with him. That he loved her with tenderness, with fondnessloved her, seemed no longer to admit of any doubt, for however distantand cold he appeared, when acting with circumspection and design, themoment he was off his guard from surprise, terror, accident of any sort,the moment that he was betrayed into acting from nature and inclination,he was constantly certain to discover a regard the most animated andflattering.This regard, however, was not more evident than his desire to concealand to conquer it; he seemed to dread even her sight, and to haveimposed upon himself the most rigid forbearance of all conversation orintercourse with her.Whence could this arise? what strange and unfathomable cause couldrender necessary a conduct so mysterious? he knew not, indeed, that sheherself wished it changed, but he could not be ignorant that his chancewith almost any woman would at least be worth trying.Was the obstacle which thus discouraged him the condition imposed byher uncle's will of giving her own name to the man she married? this sheherself thought was an unpleasant circumstance, but yet so common foran heiress, that it could hardly out-weigh the many advantages of such aconnection.Henrietta again occurred to her; the letter she had seen in her handswas still unexplained; yet her entire conviction that Henrietta was notloved by him, joined to a certainty that affection alone could evermake him think of her, lessened upon this subject her suspicions everymoment.Lady Euphrasia Pemberton, at last, rested most upon her mind, and shethought it probable some actual treaty was negociating with the Duke ofDerwent.Mrs Delvile she had every reason to believe was her friend, though shewas scrupulously delicate in avoiding either raillery or observationupon the subject of her son, whom she rarely mentioned, and never butupon occasions in which Cecilia could have no possible interest.The Father, therefore, notwithstanding all Mr Monckton had representedto the contrary, appeared to be the real obstacle; his pride mightreadily object to her birth, which though not contemptible, was merelydecent, and which, if traced beyond her grandfather, lost all title evento that epithet.ÒIf this, however,Ó she cried, Òis at last his situation, how muchhave I been to blame in censuring his conduct! for while to me he hasappeared capricious, he has, in fact, acted wholly from necessity; ifhis father insists upon his forming another connection, has he not beenhonourable, prudent and just, in flying an object that made him think ofdisobedience, and endeavouring to keep her ignorant of a partiality itis his duty to curb?ÓAll, therefore, that remained for her to do or to resolve, was to guardher own secret with more assiduous care than ever, and since she foundthat their union was by himself thought impossible, to keep from hisknowledge that the regret was not all his own.CHAPTER vi. -- A MYSTERY.For two days, in consequence of violent colds caught during the storm,Lady Honoria Pemberton and Cecilia were confined to their rooms.Cecilia, glad by solitude and reflection to compose her spirits andsettle her plan of conduct, would willingly have still prolonged herretirement, but the abatement of her cold affording her no pretence, shewas obliged on the third day to make her appearance.Lady Honoria, though less recovered, as she had been more a sufferer,was impatient of any restraint, and would take no denial to quittingher room at the same time; at dinner, therefore, all the family met atusual.Mr Delvile, with his accustomed solemnity of civility, made variousenquiries and congratulations upon their danger and their security,carefully in both, addressing himself first to Lady Honoria, and thenwith more stateliness in his kindness, to Cecilia. His lady, who hadfrequently visited them both, had nothing new to hear.Delvile did not come in till they were all seated, when, hastily sayinghe was glad to see both the ladies so well again, he instantly employedhimself in carving, with the agitation of a man who feared trustinghimself to sit idle.Little, however, as he said, Cecilia was much struck by the melancholytone of his voice, and the moment she raised her eyes, she observed thathis countenance was equally sad.ÒMortimer,Ó cried Mr Delvile, ÒI am sure you are not well; I cannotimagine why you will not have some advice.ÓÒWere I to send for a physician, Sir,Ó cried Delvile, with affectedchearfulness, Òhe would find it much more difficult to imagine whatadvice to give me.ÓÒPermit me however, Mr Mortimer,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òto return you myhumble thanks for the honour of your assistance in the thunder storm! Iam afraid you made yourself ill by attending me!ÓÒYour ladyship,Ó returned Delvile, colouring very high, yet pretendingto laugh; Òmade so great a coward of me, that I ran away from shame atmy own inferiority of courage.ÓÒWere you, then, with Lady Honoria during the storm?Ó cried Mrs Delvile.ÒNo, Madam!Ó cried Lady Honoria very quick; Òbut he was so good as toleave me during the storm.ÓÒMortimer,Ó said Mr Delvile, Òis this possible?ÓÒO Lady Honoria was such a Heroine,Ó answered Delvile, Òthat shewholly disdained receiving any assistance; her valour was so much moreundaunted than mine, that she ventured to brave the lightning under anoak tree!ÓÒNow, dear Mrs Delvile,Ó exclaimed Lady Honoria, Òthink what a simpletonhe would have made of me! he wanted to persuade me that in the open airI should be less exposed to danger than under the shelter of a thicktree!ÓÒLady Honoria,Ó replied Mrs Delvile, with a sarcastic smile, Òthe nexttale of scandal you oblige me to hear, I will insist for your punishmentthat you shall read one of Mr Newbury's little books! there are twentyof them that will explain this matter to you, and such reading will atleast employ your time as usefully as such tales!ÓÒWell, ma'am,Ó said Lady Honoria, ÒI don't know whether you are laughingat me or not, but really I concluded Mr Mortimer only chose to amusehimself in a tte--tte with Miss Beverley.ÓÒHe was not with Miss Beverley,Ó cried Mrs Delvile with quickness; Òshewas alone,--I saw her myself the moment she came in.ÓÒYes, ma'am,--but not then,-he was gone;Ó--said Cecilia, endeavouring,but not very successfully, to speak with composure.ÒI had the honour,Ó cried Delvile, making, with equal success, the sameattempt, Òto wait upon Miss Beverley to the little gate; and I was thenreturning to Lady Honoria when I met her ladyship just coming in.ÓÒVery extraordinary, Mortimer,Ó said Mr Delvile, staring, Òto attendLady Honoria the last!ÓÒDon't be angry in earnest, Sir,Ó cried Lady Honoria, gaily, Òfor I didnot mean to turn tell-tale.ÓHere the subject was dropt; greatly to the joy both of Delvile andCecilia, who mutually exerted themselves in talking upon what next wasstarted, in order to prevent its being recurred to again.That fear, however, over, Delvile said little more; sadness hung heavilyon his mind; he was absent, disturbed, uneasy; yet he endeavoured nolonger to avoid Cecilia; on the contrary, when she arose to quit theroom, he looked evidently disappointed.The ladies' colds kept them at home all the evening, and Delvile, forthe first time since their arrival at the castle, joined them at tea;nor when it was over, did he as usual retire; he loitered, pretended tobe caught by a new pamphlet, and looked as anxiously eager to speak withCecilia, as he had hitherto appeared to shun her.With new emotion and fresh distress Cecilia perceived this change; whathe might have to say she could not conjecture, but all that foreran hiscommunication convinced her it was nothing she could wish; and much asshe had desired some explanation of his designs, when the long-expectedmoment seemed arriving, prognostications the most cruel of the event,repressed her impatience, and deadened her curiosity. She earnestlylamented her unfortunate residence in his house, where the adoration ofevery inhabitant, from his father to the lowest servant, had impressedher with the strongest belief of his general worthiness, and greatly,though imperceptibly, encreased her regard for him, since she hadnow not a doubt remaining but that some cruel, some fatal obstacle,prohibited their union.To collect fortitude to hear it with composure, was now her wholestudy; but though, when alone, she thought any discovery preferable tosuspence, all her courage failed her when Delvile appeared, and if shecould not detain Lady Honoria, she involuntarily followed her.Thus passed four or five days; during which the health of Delvile seemedto suffer with his mind, and though he refused to acknowledge he wasill, it was evident to every body that he was far from well.Mr Delvile frequently urged him to consent to have some advice; buthe always revived, though with forced and transitory spirits, at themention of a physician, and the proposal ended in nothing.Mrs Delvile, too, at length grew alarmed; her enquiries were morepenetrating and pointed, but they were not more successful; everyattack of this sort was followed by immediate gaiety, which, howeverconstrained, served, for the time, to change the subject. Mrs Delvile,however, was not soon to be deceived; she watched her son incessantly,and seemed to feel an inquietude scarce less than his own.Cecilia's distress was now augmented every moment, and the difficulty toconceal it grew every hour more painful; she felt herself the cause ofthe dejection of the son, and that thought made her feel guilty in thepresence of the mother; the explanation she expected threatened her withnew misery, and the courage to endure it she tried in vain to acquire;her heart was most cruelly oppressed, apprehension and suspence neverleft it for an instant; rest abandoned her at night, and chearfulness byday.At this time the two lords, Ernolf and Derford, arrived; and Cecilia,who at first had lamented their design, now rejoiced in their presence,since they divided the attention of Mrs Delvile, which she began to fearwas not wholly directed to her son, and since they saved her fromhaving the whole force of Lady Honoria's high spirits and gay rattle toherself.Their immediate observations upon the ill looks of Delvile, startledboth Cecilia and the mother even more than their own fears, which theyhad hoped were rather the result of apprehension than of reason. Cecilianow severely reproached herself with having deferred the conferencehe was evidently seeking, not doubting but she had contributed to hisindisposition by denying him the relief he might expect from concludingthe affair.Melancholy as was this idea, it was yet a motive to overpower herreluctance, and determine her no longer to shun what it seemed necessaryto endure.Deep reasoners, however, when they are also nice casuists, frequentlyresolve with a tardiness which renders their resolutions of no effect;this was the case with Cecilia; the same morning that she came downstairs prepared to meet with firmness the blow which she believedawaited her, Delvile, who, since the arrival of the two lords, hadalways appeared at the general breakfast, acknowledged in answer to hismother's earnest enquiries, that he had a cold and head-ache; and hadhe, at the same time, acknowledged a pleurisy and fever, the alarminstantly spread in the family could not have been greater; Mr Delvile,furiously ringing the bell, ordered a man and horse to go that moment toDr Lyster, the physician to the family, and not to return without him ifhe was himself alive; and Mrs Delvile, not less distressed, though morequiet, fixed her eyes upon her son, with an expression of anxiety thatshewed her whole happiness was bound in his recovery.Delvile endeavoured to laugh away their fears, assuring them heshould be well the next day, and representing in ridiculous terms theperplexity of Dr Lyster to contrive some prescription for him.Cecilia's behaviour, guided by prudence and modesty, was steady andcomposed; she believed his illness and his uneasiness were the same, andshe hoped the resolution she had taken would bring relief to them bothwhile the terrors of Mr and Mrs Delvile seemed so greatly beyond theoccasion, that her own were rather lessened than increased by them.Dr Lyster soon arrived; he was a humane and excellent physician, and aman of sound judgment.Delvile, gaily, shaking hands with him, said ÒI believe, Dr Lyster, youlittle expected to meet a patient, who, were he as skilful, would be asable to do business as yourself.ÓÒWhat, with such a hand as this?Ó cried the Doctor; Òcome, come, youmust not teach me my own profession. When I attend a patient, I come totell how he is myself, not to be told.ÓÒHe is, then ill!Ó cried Mrs Delvile; Òoh Mortimer, why have you thusdeceived us!ÓÒWhat is his disorder?Ó cried Mr Delvile; Òlet us call in more help; whoshall we send for, doctor?ÓAnd again he rang the bell.ÒWhat now?Ó said Dr Lyster, coolly; Òmust a man be dying if he is not inperfect health? we want nobody else; I hope I can prescribe for a coldwithout demanding a consultation?ÓÒBut are you sure it is merely a cold?Ó cried Mr Delvile; Òmay not somedreadful maladyÓ--ÒPray, Sir, have patience,Ó interrupted the doctor; ÒMr Mortimer and Iwill have some discourse together presently; mean time, let us all sitdown, and behave like Christians; I never talk of my art before company.'Tis hard you won't let me be a gentleman at large for two minutes!ÓLady Honoria and Cecilia would then have risen, but neither Dr Lysternor Delvile would permit them to go; and a conversation tolerably livelytook place, after which, the party in general separating, the doctoraccompanied Delvile to his own apartment.Cecilia then went up stairs, where she most impatiently waited someintelligence; none, however, arriving, in about half an hour shereturned to the parlour; she found it empty, but was soon joined by LadyHonoria and Lord Ernolf.Lady Honoria, happy in having something going forward, and not muchconcerning herself whether it were good or evil, was as eager tocommunicate what she had gathered, as Cecilia was to hear it.ÒWell, my dear,Ó she cried, Òso I don't find at last but that all thisprodigious illness will be laid to your account.ÓÒTo my account?Ó cried Cecilia, Òhow is that possible?ÓÒWhy this tender chicken caught cold in the storm last week, and notbeing put to bed by its mama, and nursed with white-wine whey, the poorthing has got a fever.ÓÒHe is a fine young man,Ó said Lord Ernolf; ÒI should be sorry any harmhappened to him.ÓÒHe was a fine young man, my lord,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òbut he is grownintolerably stupid lately; however, it's all the fault of his father andmother. Was ever any thing half so ridiculous as their behaviour thismorning? it was with the utmost difficulty I forbore laughing in theirfaces; and really, I believe if I was to meet with such an unfortunateaccident with Mr Delvile, it would turn him to marble at once! indeedhe is little better now, but such an affront as that would never let himmove from the spot where he received it.ÓÒI forgive him, however,Ó returned Lord Ernolf, Òfor his anxiety abouthis son, since he is the last of so ancient a family.ÓÒThat is his great misfortune, my lord,Ó answered Lady Honoria, Òbecauseit is the very reason they make such a puppet of him. If there were buta few more little masters to dandle and fondle, I'll answer for it thisprecious Mortimer would soon be left to himself; and then, really, Ibelieve he would be a good tolerable sort of young man. Don't you thinkhe would, Miss Beverley?ÓÒO yes!Ó said Cecilia, ÒI believe--I think so!ÓÒNay, nay, I did not ask if you thought him tolerable now, so no need tobe frightened.ÓHere they were interrupted by the entrance of Dr Lyster.ÒWell, Sir,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òand when am I to go into mourning formy cousin Mortimer?ÓÒWhy very soon,Ó answered he, Òunless you take better care of him. Hehas confessed to me that after being out in the storm last Wednesday, hesat in his wet cloaths all the evening.ÓÒDear,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òand what would that do to him? I haveno notion of a man's always wanting a cambric handkerchief about histhroat.ÓÒPerhaps your ladyship had rather make him apply it to his eyes?Ó criedthe doctor; Òhowever, sitting inactive in wet cloaths would destroy astouter man than Mr Delvile; but he forgot it, he says! which of you twoyoung ladies could not have given as good reason?ÓÒYour most obedient,Ó said Lady Honoria, Òand why should not a lady giveas good a reason as a gentleman?ÓÒI don't know,Ó answered he, drily, Òbut from want of practice, Ibelieve.ÓÒO worse and worse!Ó cried Lady Honoria; Òyou shall never be myphysician; if I was to be attended by you, you'd make me sick instead ofwell.ÓÒAll the better,Ó answered he, Òfor then I must have the honourof attending you till I made you well instead of sick.Ó And with agood-humoured smile, he left them; and Lord Derford, at the same time,coming into the room, Cecilia contrived to stroll out into the park.The account to which she had been listening redoubled her uneasiness;she was conscious that whatever was the indisposition of Delvile, andwhether it was mental or bodily, she was herself its occasion; throughher he had been negligent, she had rendered him forgetful, and inconsulting her own fears in preference to his peace, she had avoided anexplanation, though he had vigilantly sought one. She knew not, he toldher, half the wretchedness of his heart.--Alas! thought she, he littleconjectures the state of mine!Lady Honoria suffered her not to be long alone; in about half an hourshe ran after her, gaily calling out, ÒO Miss Beverley, you have lostthe delightfullest diversion in the world! I have just had the mostridiculous scene with my Lord Derford that you ever heard in your life!I asked him what put it in his head to be in love with you,--and he hadthe simplicity to answer, quite seriously, his father!ÓÒHe was very right,Ó said Cecilia, Òif the desire of uniting two estatesis to be denominated being in love; for that, most certainly, was putinto his head by his father.ÓÒO but you have not heard half. I told him, then, that, as a friend,in confidence I must acquaint him, I believed you intended to marryMortimer--ÓÒGood heaven, Lady Honoria!ÓÒO, you shall hear the reason; because, as I assured him, it was properhe should immediately call him to account.ÓÒAre you mad, Lady Honoria?ÓÒFor you know, said I, Miss Beverley has had one duel fought for heralready, and a lady who has once had that compliment paid her, alwaysexpects it from every new admirer; and I really believe your notobserving that form is the true cause of her coldness to you.ÓÒIs it possible you can have talked so wildly?ÓÒYes, and what is much better, he believed every word I said!ÓÒMuch better?--No, indeed, it is much worse! and if, in fact, he is souncommonly weak, I shall really be but little indebted to your ladyshipfor giving him such notions.ÓÒO I would not but have done it for the world! for I never laughed soimmoderately in my life. He began assuring me he was not afraid, for hesaid he had practised fencing more than any thing; so I made him promiseto send a challenge to Mortimer as soon as he is well enough to comedown again; for Dr Lyster has ordered him to keep his room.ÓCecilia, smothering her concern for this last piece of intelligenceby pretending to feel it merely for the former, expostulated with LadyHonoria upon so mischievous a frolic, and earnestly entreated her to goback and contradict it all.ÒNo, no, not for the world!Ó cried she; Òhe has not the least spirit,and I dare say he would not fight to save the whole nation fromdestruction; but I'll make him believe that it's necessary, in order togive him something to think of, for really his poor head is so vacant,that I am sure if one might but play upon it with sticks, it would soundjust like a drum.ÓCecilia, finding it vain to combat with her fantasies, was at lengthobliged to submit.The rest of the day she passed very unpleasantly; Delvile appeared not;his father was restless and disturbed, and his mother, though attentiveto her guests, and, for their sakes rallying her spirits, was visiblyill disposed to think or to talk but of her son.One diversion, however, Cecilia found for herself; Delvile had afavourite spaniel, which, when he walked followed him, and when he rode,ran by his horse; this dog, who was not admitted into the house, she nowtook under her own care; and spent almost the whole day out of doors,chiefly for the satisfaction of making him her companion.The next morning, when Dr Lyster came again, she kept in the way, inorder to hear his opinion; and was sitting with Lady Honoria in theparlour, when he entered it to write a prescription.Mrs Delvile, in a few moments, followed him, and with a face and voiceof the tenderest maternal apprehensions, said ÒDoctor, one thing entrustme with immediately; I can neither bear imposition nor suspense;--youknow what I would say!--tell me if I have any thing to fear, that mypreparations may be adequate!ÓÒNothing, I believe, in the world.ÓÒYou believe!Ó repeated Mrs Delvile, starting; ÒOh doctor!ÓÒWhy you would not have me say I am certain, would you? these are notimes for Popery and infallibility; however, I assure you I think himperfectly safe. He has done a foolish and idle trick, but no man is wisealways. We must get rid of his fever, and then if his cold remains, withany cough, he may make a little excursion to Bristol.ÓÒTo Bristol! nay then,--I understand you too well!ÓÒNo, no, you don't understand me at all; I don't send him to Bristolbecause he is in a bad way, but merely because I mean to put him in agood one.ÓÒLet him, then, go immediately; why should he increase the danger bywaiting a moment? I will order--ÓÒHold, hold! I know what to order myself! 'Tis a strange thing peoplewill always teach me my own duty! why should I make a man travel suchweather as this in a fever? do you think I want to confine him in amad-house, or be confined in one myself?ÓÒCertainly you know best--but still if there is any danger--ÓÒNo, no, there is not! only we don't chuse there should be any. And howwill he entertain himself better than by going to Bristol? I send himmerely on a jaunt of pleasure; and I am sure he will be safer there thanshut up in a house with two such young ladies as these.ÓAnd then he made off. Mrs Delvile, too anxious for conversation, leftthe room, and Cecilia, too conscious for silence, forced herself intodiscourse with Lady Honoria.Three days she passed in this uncertainty what she had to expect;blaming those fears which had deferred an explanation, and tormentedby Lady Honoria, whose raillery and levity now grew very unseasonable.Fidel, the favourite spaniel, was almost her only consolation, and shepleased herself not inconsiderably by making a friend of the faithfulanimal.CHAPTER vii. -- AN ANECDOTE.On the fourth day the house wore a better aspect; Delvile's fever wasgone, and Dr Lyster permitted him to leave his room; a cough, however,remained, and his journey to Bristol was settled to take place in threedays. Cecilia, knowing he was now expected down stairs, hastened out ofthe parlour the moment she had finished her breakfast; for affected byhis illness, and hurt at the approaching separation, she dreaded thefirst meeting, and wished to fortify her mind for bearing it withpropriety.In a very few minutes, Lady Honoria, running after her, entreated thatshe would come down; Òfor Mortimer,Ó she cried, Òis in the parlour, andthe poor child is made so much of by its papa and mama, that I wish theydon't half kill him by their ridiculous fondness. It is amazing to me heis so patient with them, for if they teized me half as much, I should beready to jump up and shake them. But I wish you would come down, for Iassure you it's a comical scene.ÓÒYour ladyship is soon diverted! but what is there so comical in theanxiety of parents for an only son?ÓÒLord, they don't care a straw for him all the time! it's merely thathe may live to keep up this old castle, which I hope in my heart he willpull down the moment they are dead! But do pray come; it will reallygive you spirits to see them all. The father keeps ringing the bell toorder half a hundred pair of boots for him, and all the greatcoats inthe county; and the mother sits and looks as if a hearse and mourningcoach were already coming over the drawbridge; but the most divertingobject among them is my Lord Derford! O, it is really too entertainingto see him! there he sits, thinking the whole time of his challenge!I intend to employ him all this afternoon in practising to shoot at amark.ÓAnd then again she pressed her to join the group, and Cecilia, fearingher opposition might seem strange, consented.Delvile arose at her entrance, and, with tolerable steadiness, shecongratulated him on his recovery; and then, taking her usual seat,employed herself in embroidering a screen. She joined too, occasionally,in the conversation, and observed, not without surprise, that Delvileseemed much less dejected than before his confinement.Soon after, he ordered his horse, and, accompanied by Lord Derford,rode out. Mr Delvile then took Lord Ernolf to shew him some intendedimprovements in another part of the castle, and Lady Honoria walked awayin search of any entertainment she could find.Mrs Delvile, in better spirits than she had been for many days, sentfor her own work, and sitting by Cecilia, conversed with her again as informer times; mixing instruction with entertainment, and generalsatire with particular kindness, in a manner at once so lively and soflattering, that Cecilia herself reviving, found but little difficultyin bearing her part in the conversation.And thus, with some gaiety, and tolerable ease, was spent the greatestpart of the morning; but just as they were talking of changing theirdress for dinner, Lady Honoria with an air of the utmost exultation,came flying into the room. ÒWell, ma'am,Ó she cried, ÒI have some newsnow that I must tell you, because it will make you believe me anothertime though I know it will put you in a passion.ÓÒThat's sweetly designed, at least!Ó said Mrs Delvile, laughing;Òhowever, I'll trust you, for my passions will not, just now, beirritated by straws.ÓÒWhy, ma'am, don't you remember I told you when you were in town that MrMortimer kept a mistress--ÓÒYes!Ó cried Mrs Delvile, disdainfully, Òand you may remember, LadyHonoria, I told you--ÓÒO, you would not believe a word of it! but it's all true, I assure you!and now he has brought her down here; he sent for her about three weeksago, and he has boarded her at a cottage, about half a mile from thePark-gate.ÓCecilia, to whom Henrietta Belfield was instantly present, changedcolour repeatedly, and turned so extremely sick, she could withdifficulty keep her seat. She forced herself, however, to continue herwork, though she knew so little what she was about, that she put herneedle in and out of the same place without ceasing.Meanwhile Mrs Delvile, with a countenance of the utmost indignation,exclaimed, ÒLady Honoria, if you think a tale of scandal such as thisreflects no disgrace upon its relater, you must pardon me for entreatingyou to find an auditor more of the same opinion than myself.ÓÒNay, ma'am, since you are so angry, I'll tell you the whole affair, forthis is but half of it. He has a child here, too,--I vow I long to seeit!--and he is so fond of it that he spends half his time in nursingit;--and that, I suppose, is the thing that takes him out so much; and Ifancy, too, that's what has made him grow so grave, for may be he thinksit would not be pretty to be very frisky, now he's a papa.ÓNot only Cecilia, but Mrs Delvile herself was now overpowered, andshe sat for some time wholly silent and confounded; Lady Honoria then,turning to Cecilia exclaimed, ÒBless me, Miss Beverley, what are youabout! why that flower is the most ridiculous thing I ever saw! you havespoilt your whole work.ÓCecilia, in the utmost confusion, though pretending to laugh, then beganto unpick it; and Mrs Delvile, recovering, more calmly, though not lessangrily, said ÒAnd has this tale the honour of being invented solely byyour ladyship, or had it any other assistant?ÓÒO no, I assure you, it's no invention of mine; I had it from very goodauthority upon my word. But only look at Miss Beverley! would not onethink I had said that she had a child herself? She looks as pale asdeath. My dear, I am sure you can't be well?ÓÒI beg your pardon,Ó cried Cecilia, forcing a smile, though extremelyprovoked with her; ÒI never was better.ÓAnd then, with the hope of appearing unconcerned, she raised her head;but meeting the eyes of Mrs Delvile fixed upon her face with a look ofpenetrating observation, abashed and guilty, she again dropt it, andresumed her work.ÒWell, my dear,Ó said Lady Honoria, ÒI am sure there is no occasion tosend for Dr Lyster to you, for you recover yourself in a moment; youhave the finest colour now I ever saw; has not she, Mrs Delvile? did youever see anybody blush so becomingly?ÓÒI wish, Lady Honoria,Ó said Mrs Delvile, with severity, Òit werepossible to see you blush!ÓÒO but I never do! not but what it's pretty enough too; but I don't knowhow it is, it never happens. Now Euphrasia can blush from morning tonight. I can't think how she contrives it. Miss Beverley, too, playsat it vastly well; she's red and white, and white and red half a dozentimes in a minute. Especially,Ó looking at her archly, and lowering hervoice, Òif you talk to her of Mortimer!ÓÒNo, indeed! no such thing!Ó cried Cecilia with some resentment, andagain looking up; but glancing her eyes towards Mrs Delvile, andagain meeting hers, filled with the strongest expression of enquiringsolicitude, unable to sustain their inquisition, and shocked to findherself thus watchfully observed, she returned in hasty confusion to heremployment.ÒWell, my dear,Ó cried Lady Honoria, again, Òbut what are you about now?do you intend to unpick the whole screen?ÓÒHow can she tell what she is doing,Ó said Mrs Delvile, with quickness,Òif you torment her thus incessantly? I will take you away from her,that she may have a little peace. You shall do me the honour to attendmy toilette, and acquaint me with some further particulars of thisextraordinary discovery.ÓMrs Delvile then left the room, but Lady Honoria, before she followedher, said in a low voice ÒPity me, Miss Beverley, if you have the leastgood-nature! I am now going to hear a lecture of two hours long!ÓCecilia, left to herself was in a perturbation almost insupportable;Delvile's mysterious conduct seemed the result of some entanglement ofvice; Henrietta Belfield, the artless Henrietta Belfield, she feared hadbeen abused, and her own ill-fated partiality, which now more than evershe wished unknown even to herself, was evidently betrayed where mostthe dignity of her mind made her desire it to be concealed!In this state of shame, regret and resentment, which made her forget tochange her dress, or her place, she was suddenly surprised by Delvile.Starting and colouring, she busied herself with collecting her work,that she might hurry out of the room. Delvile, though silent himself,endeavoured to assist her; but when she would have gone, he attempted tostop her, saying ÒMiss Beverley, for three minutes only.ÓÒNo, sir,Ó cried she, indignantly, Ònot for an instant!Ó and leaving himutterly astonished, she hastened to her own apartment.She was then sorry she had been so precipitate; nothing had been clearlyproved against him; no authority was so likely to be fallacious as thatof Lady Honoria; neither was he under any engagement to herselfthat could give her any right to manifest such displeasure. Thesereflections, however, came too late, and the quick feelings of heragitated mind were too rapid to wait the dictates of cool reason. Atdinner she attended wholly to Lord Ernolf, whose assiduous politeness,profiting by the humour, saved her the painful effort of forcingconversation, or the guilty consciousness of giving way to silence,and enabled her to preserve her general tenor between taciturnity andloquaciousness. Mrs Delvile she did not once dare look at; but her son,she saw, seemed greatly hurt; yet it was proudly, not sorrowfully, andtherefore she saw it with less uneasiness.During the rest of the day, which was passed in general society, MrsDelvile, though much occupied, frequently leaving the room, and sendingfor Lady Honoria, was more soft, kind and gentle with Cecilia than ever,looking at her with the utmost tenderness, often taking her hand,and speaking to her with even unusual sweetness. Cecilia with mingledsadness and pleasure observed this encreasing regard, which shecould not but attribute to the discovery made through Lady Honoria'smischievous intelligence, and which, while it rejoiced her withthe belief of her approbation, added fresh force to her regret inconsidering it was fruitless. Delvile, mean-time, evidently offendedhimself, conversed only with the gentlemen, and went very early into hisown room.When they were all retiring, Mrs Delvile, following Cecilia, dismissedher maid to talk with her alone.ÒI am not, I hope, often,Ó she cried, Òsolicitous or importunate tospeak about my son; his character, I believe, wants no vindication;clear and unsullied, it has always been its own support; yet theaspersion cast upon it this morning by Lady Honoria, I think myselfbound to explain, not partially as his mother, but simply as hisfriend.ÓCecilia, who knew not whither such an explanation might lead, norwherefore it was made, heard this opening with much emotion, but gaveneither to that nor to what followed any interruption.Mrs Delvile then continued; she had taken the trouble, she said, to siftthe whole affair, in order to shame Lady Honoria by a pointed convictionof what she had invented, and to trace from the foundation thecircumstances whence her surmises or report had sprung.Delvile, it seems, about a fortnight before the present time, in one ofhis morning walks, had observed a gipsey sitting by the side of the highroad, who seemed extremely ill, and who had a very beautiful child tiedto her back.Struck with the baby, he stopt to enquire to whom it belonged; toherself, she said, and begged his charity with the most pitiable criesof distress; telling him that she was travelling to join some of herfraternity, who were in a body near Bath, but was so ill with an agueand fever that she feared she should die on the road.Delvile desired her to go to the next cottage, and promised to pay forher board there till she was better. He then spoke to the man and hiswife who owned it to take them in, who, glad to oblige his Honour,instantly consented, and he had since called twice to see in what mannerthey went on.ÒHow simple,Ó continued Mrs Delvile, Òis a matter of fact in itself, andhow complex when embellished! This tale has been told by the cottagersto our servants; it has travelled, probably gaining something from everymouth, to Lady Honoria's maid, and, having reached her ladyship, wasswelled in a moment into all we heard! I think, however, that, for sometime at least, her levity will be rather less daring. I have not, inthis affair, at all spared her; I made her hear from Mortimer himselfthe little story as it happened; I then carried her to the cottage,where we had the whole matter confirmed; and I afterwards insisted uponbeing told myself by her maid all she had related to her lady, that shemight thus be unanswerably convicted of inventing whatever she omitted.I have occasioned her some confusion, and, for the moment, a littleresentment; but she is so volatile that neither will last; and though,with regard to my own family, I may perhaps have rendered her morecautious, I fear, with regard to the world in general, she is utterlyincorrigible, because it has neither pleasure nor advantage to offer,that can compensate for the deprivation of relating one staring story,or ridiculous anecdote.ÓAnd then, wishing her good night, she added, ÒI make not any apology forthis detail, which you owe, not, believe me, to a mother's folly, but,if I [know] myself at all, to a love of truth and justice. Mortimer,independent of all connection with me, cannot but to every body appearof a character which may be deemed even exemplary; calumny, therefore,falling upon such a subject, injures not only himself but society, sinceit weakens all confidence in virtue, and strengthens the scepticism ofdepravity.ÓShe then left her.ÒAh!Ó thought Cecilia, Òto me, at least, this solicitude for his fameneeds no apology! humane and generous Delvile! never, again, will I amoment doubt your worthiness!Ó And then, cherishing that darling idea,she forgot all her cares and apprehensions, her quarrel, her suspicions,and the approaching separation, and, recompensed for every thing by thisrefutation of his guilt, she hastened to bed, and composed herself torest.CHAPTER viii. -- A CONFERENCE.Early the next morning Cecilia had a visit from Lady Honoria, who cameto tell her story her own way, and laugh at the anxiety of Mrs Delvile,and the trouble she had taken; Òfor, after all,Ó continued she, Òwhatdid the whole matter signify? and how could I possibly help the mistake?when I heard of his paying for a woman's board, what was so natural asto suppose she must be his mistress? especially as there was a childin the case. O how I wish you had been with us! you never saw such aridiculous sight in your life; away we went in the chaise full drive tothe cottage, frightening all the people almost into fits; out came thepoor woman, away ran the poor man,--both of them thought the end ofthe world at hand! The gipsey was best off, for she went to her oldbusiness, and began begging. I assure you, I believe she would be verypretty if she was not so ill, and so I dare say Mortimer thought too, orI fancy he would not have taken such care of her.ÓÒFie, fie, Lady Honoria! will nothing bring conviction to you?ÓÒNay, you know, there's no harm in that, for why should not prettypeople live as well as ugly ones? There's no occasion to leave nothingin the world but frights. I looked hard at the baby, to see if it waslike Mortimer, but I could not make it out; those young things are likenothing. I tried if it would talk, for I wanted sadly to make it callMrs Delvile grandmama; however, the little urchin could say nothing tobe understood. O what a rage would Mrs Delvile have been in! I supposethis whole castle would hardly have been thought heavy enough to crushsuch an insolent brat, though it were to have fallen upon it all at ablow!ÓThus rattled this light-hearted lady till the family was assembled tobreakfast; and then Cecilia, softened towards Delvile by newly-excitedadmiration, as well as by the absence which would separate them thefollowing day, intended, by every little courteous office in her power,to make her peace with him before his departure; but she observed, withmuch chagrin, that Mrs Delvile never ceased to watch her, which, addedto an air of pride in the coldness of Delvile, that he had never beforeassumed, discouraged her from making the attempt, and compelled her toseem quiet and unconcerned.As soon as breakfast was over, the gentlemen all rode or walked out;and when the ladies were by themselves, Lady Honoria suddenly exclaimed,ÒMrs Delvile, I can't imagine for what reason you send Mr Mortimer toBristol.ÓÒFor a reason, Lady Honoria, that with all your wildness, I should bevery sorry you should know better by experience.ÓÒWhy then, ma'am; had we not better make a party, and all go? MissBeverley, should you like to join it? I am afraid it would be vastlydisagreeable to you.ÓCecilia, now again was red and white, and white and red a dozen timesin a minute; and Mrs Delvile, rising and taking her hand, expressivelysaid, ÒMiss Beverley, you have a thousand times too much sensibility forthis mad-cap of a companion. I believe I shall punish her by taking youaway from her all this morning; will you come and sit with me in thedressing-room?ÓCecilia assented without daring to look at her, and followed intrembling, up stairs. Something of importance, she fancied, wouldensue, her secret she saw was revealed, and therefore she could form noconjecture but that Delvile would be the subject of their discourse yetwhether to explain his behaviour, or plead his cause, whether to expressher separate approbation, or communicate some intelligence from himself,she had neither time, opportunity nor clue to unravel. All that wasundoubted seemed the affection of Mrs Delvile, all that, on her ownpart, could be resolved, was to suppress her partiality till she knew ifit might properly be avowed.Mrs Delvile, who saw her perturbation, led immediately to subjects ofindifference, and talked upon them so long, and with so much ease, thatCecilia, recovering her composure, began to think she had been mistaken,and that nothing was intended but a tranquil conversation.As soon, however, as she had quieted her apprehensions, she sat silentherself, with a look that Cecilia easily construed into thoughtfulperplexity in what manner she should introduce what she meant tocommunicate.This pause was succeeded by her speaking of Lady Honoria; Òhow wild, howcareless, how incorrigible she is! she lost her mother early; and theDuke, who idolizes her, and who, marrying very late, is already anold man, she rules entirely; with him, and a supple governess, who hasneither courage to oppose her, nor heart to wish well but to her owninterest, she has lived almost wholly. Lately, indeed, she has come moreinto the world, but without even a desire of improvement, and withno view and no thought but to gratify her idle humour by laughing atwhatever goes forward.ÓÒShe certainly neither wants parts nor discernment,Ó said Cecilia; Òand,when my mind is not occupied by other matters, I find her conversationentertaining and agreeable.ÓÒYes,Ó said Mrs Delvile, Òbut that light sort of wit which attacks,with equal alacrity, what is serious or what is gay, is twenty timesoffensive, to once that it is exhilarating; since it shews that whileits only aim is self-diversion, it has the most insolent negligence withrespect to any pain it gives to others. The rank of Lady Honoria, thoughit has not rendered her proud, nor even made her conscious she has anydignity to support, has yet given her a saucy indifference whom shepleases or hurts, that borders upon what in a woman is of all things themost odious, a daring defiance of the world and its opinions.ÓCecilia, never less disposed to enter upon her defence, made but littleanswer; and, soon after, Mrs Delvile added, ÒI heartily wish she wereproperly established; and yet, according to the pernicious manners andmaxims of the present age, she is perhaps more secure from misconductwhile single, than she will be when married. Her father, I fear, willleave her too much to herself, and in that case I scarce know what maybecome of her; she has neither judgment nor principle to direct herchoice, and therefore, in all probability, the same whim which one daywill guide it, will the next lead her to repent it.ÓAgain they were both silent; and then Mrs Delvile, gravely, yet withenergy exclaimed, ÒHow few are there, how very few, who marry atonce upon principles rational, and feelings pleasant! interest andinclination are eternally at strife, and where either is whollysacrificed, the other is inadequate to happiness. Yet how rarely do theydivide the attention! the young are rash, and the aged are mercenary;their deliberations are never in concert, their views are scarceever blended; one vanquishes, and the other submits; neither partytemporizes, and commonly each is unhappy.ÓÒThe time,Ó she continued, Òis now arrived when reflections of this sortcannot too seriously occupy me; the errors I have observed in others,I would fain avoid committing; yet such is the blindness of self-love,that perhaps, even at the moment I censure them, I am falling, withoutconsciousness, into the same! nothing, however, shall through negligencebe wrong; for where is the son who merits care and attention, ifMortimer from his parents deserves not to meet them?ÓThe expectations of Cecilia were now again awakened, and awakened withfresh terrors lest Mrs Delvile, from compassion, meant to offer herservices; vigorously, therefore, she determined to exert herself, andrather give up Mortimer and all thoughts of him for ever, than submit toreceive assistance in persuading him to the union.ÒMr Delvile,Ó she continued, Òis most earnest and impatient that somealliance should take place without further delay; and for myself, couldI see him with propriety and with happiness disposed of, what a weightof anxiety would be removed from my heart!ÓCecilia now made an effort to speak, attempting to say ÒCertainly, itis a matter of great consequence;Ó but so low was her voice, and soconfused her manner, that Mrs Delvile, though attentively listening,heard not a word. She forbore, however, to make her repeat what shesaid, and went on herself as if speaking in answer.ÒNot only his own, but the peace of his whole family will depend uponhis election, since he is the last of his race. This castle and estate,and another in the north, were entailed upon him by the late LordDelvile, his grandfather, who, disobliged by his eldest son, the presentlord, left every thing he had power to dispose of to his second son,Mr Delvile, and at his death, to his grandson, Mortimer. And even thepresent lord, though always at variance with his brother, is fond of hisnephew, and has declared him his heir. I, also, have one sister, who isrich, who has no children, and who has made the same declaration.Yet though with such high expectations, he must not connect himselfimprudently; for his paternal estate wants repair, and he is wellentitled with a wife to expect what it requires.ÓMost true! thought Cecilia, yet ashamed of her recent failure, sheapplied herself to her work, and would not again try to speak.ÒHe is amiable, accomplished, well educated, and well born; far may welook, and not meet with his equal; no woman need disdain, and few womenwould refuse him.ÓCecilia blushed her concurrence; yet could well at that moment havespared hearing the eulogy.ÒYet how difficult,Ó she continued, Òto find a proper alliance!there are many who have some recommendations, but who is there whollyunexceptionable?ÓThis question seemed unanswerable; nor could Cecilia devise what itmeant.ÒGirls of high family have but seldom large fortunes, since the heads oftheir house commonly require their whole wealth for the support oftheir own dignity; while on the other hand, girls of large fortune arefrequently ignorant, insolent, or low born; kept up by their friendslest they should fall a prey to adventurers, they have no acquaintancewith the world, and little enlargement from education; theirinstructions are limited to a few merely youthful accomplishments; thefirst notion they imbibe is of their own importance, the first lessonthey are taught is the value of riches, and even from their cradles,their little minds are narrowed, and their self-sufficiency is excited,by cautions to beware of fortune-hunters, and assurances that the wholeworld will be at their feet. Among such should we seek a companion forMortimer? surely not. Formed for domestic happiness, and delightingin elegant society, his mind would disdain an alliance in which itsaffections had no share.ÓCecilia colouring and trembling, thought now the moment of her trial wasapproaching, and half mortified and half frightened prepared herself tosustain it with firmness.ÒI venture, therefore, my dear Miss Beverley, to speak to you upon thissubject as a friend who will have patience to hear my perplexities; yousee upon what they hang,--where the birth is such as Mortimer Delvilemay claim, the fortune generally fails; and where the fortune isadequate to his expectations, the birth yet more frequently woulddisgrace us.ÓCecilia, astonished by this speech, and quite off her guard frommomentary surprize, involuntarily raised her head to look at MrsDelvile, in whose countenance she observed the most anxious concern,though her manner of speaking had seemed placid and composed.ÒOnce,Ó she continued, without appearing to remark the emotion ofher auditor, ÒMr Delvile thought of uniting him with his cousin LadyHonoria; but he never could endure the proposal; and who shall blame hisrepugnance? her sister, indeed, Lady Euphrasia, is much preferable, hereducation has been better, and her fortune is much more considerable.At present, however, Mortimer seems greatly averse to her, and who has aright to be difficult, if we deny it to him?ÓWonder, uncertainty, expectation and suspence now all attacked Cecilia,and all harassed her with redoubled violence; why she was called to thisconference she knew not; the approbation she had thought so certain, shedoubted, and the proposal of assistance she had apprehended, she ceasedto think would be offered some fearful mystery, some cruel obscurity,still clouded all her prospects, and not merely obstructed her viewof the future, but made what was immediately before her gloomy andindistinct.The state of her mind seemed read by Mrs Delvile, who examined her witheyes of such penetrating keenness, that they rather made discoveriesthan enquiries. She was silent some time, and looked irresolute how toproceed; but at length, she arose, and taking Cecilia by the hand, whoalmost drew it back from her dread of what would follow, she said ÒIwill torment you no more, my sweet young friend, with perplexities whichyou cannot relieve; this only I will say, and then drop the subject forever; when my solicitude for Mortimer is removed, and he is establishedto the satisfaction of us all, no care will remain in the heart of hismother, half so fervent, so anxious and so sincere as the disposal ofmy amiable Cecilia, for whose welfare and happiness my wishes are evenmaternal.ÓShe then kissed her glowing cheek, and perceiving her almost stupifiedwith astonishment, spared her any effort to speak, by hastily leavingher in possession of her room.Undeceived in her expectations and chilled in her hopes, the heartof Cecilia no longer struggled to sustain its dignity, or conceal itstenderness; the conflict was at an end, Mrs Delvile had been open,though her son was mysterious; but, in removing her doubts, she hadbereft her of her peace. She now found her own mistake in building uponher approbation; she saw nothing was less in her intentions, and thateven when most ardent in affectionate regard, she separated herinterest from that of her son as if their union was a matter of utterimpossibility. ÒYet why,Ó cried Cecilia, Òoh why is it deemed so! thatshe loves me, she is ever eager to proclaim, that my fortune would be,peculiarly useful, she makes not a secret, and that I, at least, shouldstart no insuperable objections, she has, alas! but too obviouslydiscovered! Has she doubts of her son?--no, she has too muchdiscernment; the father, then, the haughty, impracticable father,has destined him for some woman of rank, and will listen to no otheralliance.ÓThis notion somewhat soothed her in the disappointment she suffered; yetto know herself betrayed to Mrs Delvile, and to see no other consequenceensue but that of exciting a tender compassion, which led her todiscourage, from benevolence, hopes too high to be indulged, was amortification so severe, that it caused her a deeper depression ofspirits than any occurrence of her life had yet occasioned.ÒWhat Henrietta Belfield is to me,Ó she cried, ÒI am to Mrs Delvile! butwhat in her is amiable and artless, in me is disgraceful and unworthy.And this is the situation which so long I have desired! This is thechange of habitation which I thought would make me so happy! oh who canchuse, who can judge for himself? who can point out the road to his ownfelicity, or decide upon the spot where his peace will be ensured!ÓStill, however, she had something to do, some spirit to exert, and somefortitude to manifest; Mortimer, she was certain, suspected not his ownpower; his mother, she knew, was both too good and too wise to revealit to him, and she determined, by caution and firmness upon hisleave-taking and departure, to retrieve, if possible, that credit withMrs Delvile, which she feared her betrayed susceptibility had weakened.As soon, therefore, as she recovered from her consternation, she quittedMrs Delvile's apartment, and seeking Lady Honoria herself, determinednot to spend even a moment alone, till Mortimer was gone; lest thesadness of her reflections should overpower her resolution, and give amelancholy to her air and manner which he might attribute, with but toomuch justice, to concern upon his own account.CHAPTER ix. -- AN ATTACK.At dinner, with the assistance of Lord Ernolf, who was most happy togive it, Cecilia seemed tolerably easy. Lord Derford, too, encouragedby his father, endeavoured to engage some share of her attention; buthe totally failed; her mind was superior to little arts of coquetry, andher pride had too much dignity to evaporate in pique; she determined,therefore, at this time, as at all others, to be consistent in shewinghim he had no chance of her favour.At tea, when they were again assembled, Mortimer's journey was the onlysubject of discourse, and it was agreed that he should set out veryearly in the morning, and, as the weather was extremely hot, not travelat all in the middle of the day.Lady Honoria then, in a whisper to Cecilia, said, ÒI suppose, MissBeverley, you will rise with the lark to-morrow morning? for yourhealth, I mean. Early rising, you know, is vastly good for you.ÓCecilia, affecting not to understand her, said she should rise, shesupposed, at her usual time.ÒI'll tell Mortimer, however,Ó returned her ladyship, Òto look up atyour window before he goes off; for if he will play Romeo, you, I daresay, will play Juliet, and this old castle is quite the thing for themusty family of the Capulets; I dare say Shakespeare thought of it whenhe wrote of them.ÓÒSay to him what you please for yourself,Ó cried Cecilia, Òbut let meentreat you to say nothing for me.ÓÒAnd my Lord Derford,Ó continued she, Òwill make an excessive prettyParis, for he is vastly in love, though he has got nothing to say; butwhat shall we do for a Mercutio? we may find five hundred whiningRomeos to one gay and charming Mercutio. Besides, Mrs Delvile, to do herjustice, is really too good for the old Nurse, though Mr Delvile himselfmay serve for all the Capulets and all the Montagues at once, for he haspride enough for both their houses, and twenty more besides. By the way,if I don't take care, I shall have this Romeo run away before I havemade my little dainty country Paris pick a quarrel with him.ÓShe then walked up to one of the windows, and motioning Lord Derford tofollow her, Cecilia heard her say to him, ÒWell, my lord, have you writyour letter? and have you sent it? Miss Beverley, I assure you, will becharmed beyond measure by such a piece of gallantry.ÓÒNo, ma'am,Ó answered the simple young lord, ÒI have not sent it yet,for I have only writ a foul copy.ÓÒO my lord,Ó cried she, Òthat is the very thing you ought to send! afoul copy of a challenge is always better than a fair one, for it lookswritten with more agitation. I am vastly glad you mentioned that.ÓCecilia then, rising and joining them, said, ÒWhat mischief is LadyHonoria about now? we must all be upon our guards, my lord, for she hasa spirit of diversion that will not spare us.ÓÒPray why do you interfere?Ó cried Lady Honoria, and then, in a lowervoice, she added, Òwhat do you apprehend? do you suppose Mortimer cannotmanage such a poor little ideot as this?ÓÒI don't suppose any thing about the matter!ÓÒWell, then, don't interrupt my operations. Lord Derford, Miss Beverleyhas been whispering me, that if you put this scheme in execution, sheshall find you, ever after, irresistible.ÓÒLord Derford, I hope,Ó said Cecilia, laughing, Òis too well acquaintedwith your ladyship to be in any danger of credulity.ÓÒVastly well!Ó cried she, ÒI see you are determined to provoke me, so ifyou spoil my schemes, I will spoil yours, and tell a certain gentlemanyour tender terrors for his safety.ÓCecilia now, extremely alarmed, most earnestly entreated her to bequiet; but the discovery of her fright only excited her ladyship'slaughter, and, with a look the most mischievously wicked, she called outÒPray Mr Mortimer, come hither!ÓMortimer instantly obeyed; and Cecilia at the same moment would withpleasure have endured almost any punishment to have been twenty milesoff.ÒI have something,Ó continued her ladyship, Òof the utmost consequenceto communicate to you. We have been settling an admirable plan for you;will you promise to be guided by us if I tell it you?ÓÒO certainly!Ó cried he; Òto doubt that would disgrace us all round.ÓÒWell, then,--Miss Beverley, have you any objection to my proceeding?Ó ÒNone at all!Ó answered Cecilia, who had the understanding to know thatthe greatest excitement to ridicule is opposition.ÒWell, then, I must tell you,Ó she continued, Òit is the advice of usall, that as soon as you come to the possession of your estate, you makesome capital alterations in this antient castle.ÓCecilia, greatly relieved, could with gratitude have embraced her; andMortimer, very certain that such rattle was all her own, promised theutmost submission to her orders, and begged her further directions,declaring that he could not, at least, desire a fairer architect.ÒWhat we mean,Ó said she, Òmay be effected with the utmost ease; it isonly to take out these old windows, and fix some thick iron grates intheir place, and so turn the castle into a gaol for the county.ÓMortimer laughed heartily at this proposition; but his father,unfortunately hearing it, sternly advanced, and with great austeritysaid, ÒIf I thought my son capable of putting such an insult upon hisancestors, whatever may be the value I feel for him, I would banish himmy presence for ever.ÓÒDear Sir,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òhow would his ancestors ever know it?ÓÒHow?--why--that is a very extraordinary question, Lady Honoria!ÓÒBesides, Sir, I dare say the sheriff, or the mayor and corporation, orsome of those sort of people, would give him money enough, for the useof it, to run him up a mighty pretty neat little box somewhere nearRichmond.ÓÒA box!Ó exclaimed he indignantly; Òa neat little box for the heir of anestate such as this!ÓÒI only mean,Ó cried she, giddily, Òthat he might have some placea little more pleasant to live in, for really that old moat anddraw-bridge are enough to vapour him to death; I cannot for my lifeimagine any use they are of; unless, indeed, to frighten away the deer,for nothing else offer to come over. But, if you were to turn the houseinto a gaol--ÓÒA gaol?Ó cried Mr Delvile, still more angrily, Òyour ladyship mustpardon me if I entreat you not to mention that word again when you arepleased to speak of Delvile Castle.ÓÒDear Sir, why not?ÓÒBecause it is a term that, in itself, from a young lady, has a soundpeculiarly improper; and which, applied to any gentleman's antientfamily seat,--a thing, Lady Honoria, always respectable, however lightlyspoken of!--has an effect the least agreeable that can be devised; forit implies an idea either that the family, or the mansion, is going intodecay.ÓÒWell, Sir, you know, with regard to the mansion, it is certainly verytrue, for all that other side, by the old tower, looks as if it wouldfall upon one's head every time one is forced to pass it.ÓÒI protest, Lady Honoria,Ó said Mr Delvile, Òthat old tower, ofwhich you are pleased to speak so slightingly, is the most honourabletestimony to the antiquity of the castle of any now remaining, and Iwould not part with it for all the new boxes, as you style them, in thekingdom.ÓÒI am sure I am very glad of it, Sir, for I dare say nobody would giveeven one of them for it.ÓÒPardon me, Lady Honoria, you are greatly mistaken; they would give athousand; such a thing, belonging to a man from his own ancestors, isinvaluable.ÓÒWhy, dear Sir, what in the world could they do with it? unless, indeed,they were to let some man paint it for an opera scene.ÓÒA worthy use indeed!Ó cried Mr Delvile, more and more affronted; Òandpray does your ladyship talk thus to my Lord Duke?ÓÒO yes; and he never minds it at all.ÓÒIt were strange if he did!Ó cried Mrs Delvile; Òmy only astonishment isthat anybody can be found who does mind it.ÓÒWhy now, Mrs Delvile,Ó she answered, Òpray be sincere; can you possiblythink this Gothic ugly old place at all comparable to any of the newvillas about town?ÓÒGothic ugly old place!Ó repeated Mr Delvile, in utter amazement at herdauntless flightiness; Òyour ladyship really does my humble dwelling toomuch honour!ÓÒLord, I beg a thousand pardons!Ó cried she, ÒI really did not think ofwhat I was saying. Come, dear Miss Beverley, and walk out with me, for Iam too much shocked to stay a moment longer.ÓAnd then, taking Cecilia by the arm, she hurried her into the park,through a door which led thither from the parlour.ÒFor heaven's sake, Lady Honoria,Ó said Cecilia, Òcould you find nobetter entertainment for Mr Delvile than ridiculing his own house?ÓÒO,Ó cried she, laughing, Òdid you never hear us quarrel before? whywhen I was here last summer, I used to affront him ten times a day.ÓÒAnd was that a regular ceremony?ÓÒNo, really, I did not do it purposely; but it so happened; eitherby talking of the castle, or the tower, or the draw-bridge, or thefortifications; or wishing they were all employed to fill up that odiousmoat; or something of that sort; for you know a small matter will puthim out of humour.ÓÒAnd do you call it so small a matter to wish a man's whole habitationannihilated?ÓÒLord, I don't wish anything about it! I only say so to provoke him.ÓÒAnd what strange pleasure can that give you?ÓÒO the greatest in the world! I take much delight in seeing anybody in apassion. It makes them look so excessively ugly!ÓÒAnd is that the way you like every body should look, Lady Honoria?ÓÒO my dear, if you mean me, I never was in a passion twice in my life;for as soon as ever I have provoked the people, I always run away. Butsometimes I am in a dreadful fright lest they should see me laugh, forthey make such horrid grimaces it is hardly possible to look at them.When my father has been angry with me, I have sometimes been obliged topretend I was crying, by way of excuse for putting my handkerchief to myface; for really he looks so excessively hideous, you would suppose hewas making mouths, like the children, merely to frighten one.ÓÒAmazing!Ó exclaimed Cecilia, Òyour ladyship can, indeed, never wantdiversion, to find it in the anger of your father. But does it give youno other sensation? are you not afraid?ÓÒO never! O what can he do to me, you know? he can only storm a little,and swear a little, for he always swears when he is angry; and perhapsorder me to my own room; and ten to one but that happens to be the verything I want; for we never quarrel but when we are alone, and then it'sso dull, I am always wishing to run away.ÓÒAnd can you take no other method of leaving him?ÓÒWhy I think none so easily; and it can do him no harm, you know;I often tell him, when we make friends, that if it were not for apostilion and his daughter, he would be quite out of practice inscolding and swearing; for whenever he is upon the road he does nothingelse; though why he is in such a hurry, nobody can divine, for gowhither he will he has nothing to do.ÓThus ran on this flighty lady, happy in high animal spirits, andcareless who was otherwise, till, at some distance, they perceived LordDerford, who was approaching to join them.ÒMiss Beverley,Ó cried she, Òhere comes your adorer; I shall thereforeonly walk on till we arrive at that large oak, and then make himprostrate himself at your feet, and leave you together.ÓÒYour ladyship is extremely good! but I am glad to be apprized of yourintention, as it will enable me to save you that trouble.ÓShe then turned quick back, and passing Lord Derford, who still walkedon towards Lady Honoria, she returned to the house; but, upon enteringthe parlour, found all the company dispersed, Delvile alone excepted,who was walking about the room, with his tablets in his hand, in whichhe had been writing.From a mixture of shame and surprize, Cecilia, at the sight of him, wasinvoluntarily retreating; but, hastening to the door, he called out in areproachful tone, ÒWill you not even enter the same room with me?ÓÒO yes,Ó cried she, returning; ÒI was only afraid I disturbed you.ÓÒNo, madam,Ó answered he, gravely; Òyou are the only person who couldnot disturb me, since my employment was making memorandums for a letterto yourself; with which, however, I did not desire to importune you, butthat you have denied me the honour of even a five minutes' audience.ÓCecilia, in the utmost confusion at this attack, knew not whether tostand still or proceed; but, as he presently continued his speech, shefound she had no choice but to stay.ÒI should be sorry to quit this place, especially as the length of myabsence is extremely uncertain, while I have the unhappiness to be underyour displeasure, without making some little attempt to apologize forthe behaviour which incurred it. Must I, then, finish my letter, or willyou at last deign to hear me?ÓÒMy displeasure, Sir,Ó said Cecilia, Òdied with its occasion; I beg,therefore, that it may rest no longer in your remembrance.ÓÒI meant not, madam, to infer, that the subject or indeed that theobject merited your deliberate attention; I simply wish to explain whatmay have appeared mysterious in my conduct, and for what may have seemedstill more censurable, to beg your pardon.ÓCecilia now, recovered from her first apprehensions, and calmed, becausepiqued, by the calmness with which he spoke himself, made no oppositionto his request, but suffering him to shut both the door leading into thegarden, and that which led into the hall, she seated herself at one ofthe windows, determined to listen with intrepidity to this long expectedexplanation.The preparations, however, which he made to obviate being overheard,added to the steadiness with which Cecilia waited his furtherproceedings, soon robbed him of the courage with which he began theassault, and evidently gave him a wish of retreating himself.At length, after much hesitation, he said ÒThis indulgence, madam,deserves my most grateful acknowledgments; it is, indeed, what I hadlittle right, and still less reason, after the severity I have met withfrom you, to expect.ÓAnd here, at the very mention of severity, his courage, called upon byhis pride, instantly returned, and he went on with the same spirit hehad begun.ÒThat severity, however, I mean not to lament; on the contrary, ina situation such as mine, it was perhaps the first blessing I couldreceive; I have found from it, indeed, more advantage and relief thanfrom all that philosophy, reflection or fortitude could offer. It hasshewn me the vanity of bewailing the barrier, placed by fate to mywishes, since it has shewn me that another, less inevitable, but equallyinsuperable, would have opposed them. I have determined, therefore,after a struggle I must confess the most painful, to deny myself thedangerous solace of your society, and endeavour, by joining dissipationto reason, to forget the too great pleasure which hitherto it hasafforded me.ÓÒEasy, Sir,Ó cried Cecilia, Òwill be your task; I can only wish there-establishment of your health may be found no more difficult.ÓÒAh, madam,Ó cried he, with a reproachful smile, Òhe jests at scars whonever felt a wound!--but this is a strain in which I have no right totalk, and I will neither offend your delicacy, nor my own integrity, byendeavouring to work upon the generosity of your disposition in order toexcite your compassion. Not such was the motive with which I begged thisaudience; but merely a desire, before I tear myself away, to open to youmy heart, without palliation or reserve.ÓHe paused a few moments; and Cecilia finding her suspicions just thatthis interview was meant to be final, considered that her trial, howeversevere, would be short, and called forth all her resolution to sustainit with spirit.ÒLong before I had the honour of your acquaintance,Ó he continued, Òyourcharacter and your accomplishments were known to me; Mr Biddulph ofSuffolk, who was my first friend at Oxford, and with whom my intimacyis still undiminished, was early sensible of your excellencies;we corresponded, and his letters were filled with your praises. Heconfessed to me, that his admiration had been unfortunate;--alas! Imight now make the same confession to him!ÓMr Biddulph, among many of the neighbouring gentlemen, had madeproposals to the Dean for Cecilia, which, at her desire, were rejected.ÒWhen Mr Harrel saw masks in Portman-square, my curiosity to behold alady so adored, and so cruel, led me thither; your dress made you easilydistinguished.--Ah Miss Beverley! I venture not to mention what I thenfelt for my friend! I will only say that something which I felt formyself, warned me instantly to avoid you, since the clause in youruncle's will was already well known to me.ÓNow, then, at last, thought Cecilia, all perplexity is over!--the changeof name is the obstacle; he inherits all the pride of his family,--andtherefore to that family will I unrepining leave him!ÒThis warning,Ó he continued, ÒI should not have disregarded, had Inot, at the Opera, been deceived into a belief you were engaged; I thenwished no longer to shun you; bound in honour to forbear all efforts atsupplanting a man, to whom I thought you almost united, I considered youalready as married, and eagerly as I sought your society, I sought itnot with more pleasure than innocence. Yet even then, to be candid,I found in myself a restlessness about your affairs that kept me ineternal perturbation; but I flattered myself it was mere curiosity, andonly excited by the perpetual change of opinion to which occasion gaverise, concerning which was the happy man.ÓÒI am sorry,Ó said Cecilia, coolly, Òthere was any such mistake.ÓÒI will not, madam, fatigue you,Ó he returned, Òby tracing the progressof my unfortunate admiration; will endeavour to be more brief, for Isee you are already wearied.Ó He stopt a moment, hoping for some littleencouragement; but Cecilia, in no humour to give it, assumed an air ofunconcern, and sat wholly quiet.ÒI knew not,Ó he then went on, with a look of extreme mortification,Òthe warmth with which I honoured your virtues, till you deigned toplead to me for Mr Belfield,--but let me not recollect the feelings ofthat moment!--yet were they nothing,--cold, languid, lifeless to what Iafterwards experienced, when you undeceived me finally with respect toyour situation, and informed me the report concerning Sir Robert Floyerwas equally erroneous with that which concerned Belfield! O what was theagitation of my whole soul at that instant!--to know you disengaged,--tosee you before me,--by the disorder of my whole frame to discover themistake I had cherished--ÓCecilia then, half rising, yet again seating herself, looked extremelyimpatient to be gone.ÒPardon me, madam,Ó he cried; ÒI will have done, and trace my feelingsand my sufferings no longer, but hasten, for my own sake as well asyours, to the reason why I have spoken at all. From the hour thatmy ill-destined passion was fully known to myself, I weighed all theconsequences of indulging it, and found, added to the extreme hazard ofsuccess, an impropriety even in the attempt. My honour in the honourof my family is bound; what to that would seem wrong, in me would beunjustifiable; yet where inducements so numerous were opposed by onesingle objection!--where virtue, beauty, education and family were allunexceptionable,--Oh cruel clause! barbarous and repulsive clause! thatforbids my aspiring to the first of women, but by an action that with myown family would degrade me for ever!ÓHe stopt, overpowered by his own emotion, and Cecilia arose. ÒI see,madam,Ó he cried, Òyour eagerness to be gone, and however at this momentI may lament it, I shall recollect it hereafter with advantage. But toconclude; I determined to avoid you, and, by avoiding, to endeavour toforget you; I determined, also, that no human being, and yourself leastof all, should know, should even suspect the situation of my mind; andthough upon various occasions, my prudence and forbearance have suddenlyyielded to surprise and to passion, the surrender has been short, andalmost, I believe, unnoticed.ÒThis silence and this avoidance I sustained with decent constancy, tillduring the storm, in an ill-fated moment, I saw, or thought I saw you insome danger, and then, all caution off guard, all resolution surprised,every passion awake, and tenderness triumphant--ÓÒWhy, Sir,Ó cried Cecilia, angrily, Òand for what purpose all this?ÓÒAlas, I know not!Ó said he, with a deep sigh, ÒI thought myself betterqualified for this conference, and meant to be firm and concise. I havetold my story ill, but as your own understanding will point out thecause, your own benevolence will perhaps urge some excuse.ÒToo certain, since that unfortunate accident, that all disguise wasvain, and convinced by your displeasure of the impropriety of which Ihad been guilty, I determined, as the only apology I could offer, toopen to you my whole heart, and then fly you perhaps for ever.ÒThis, madam, incoherently indeed, yet with sincerity, I have now done;my sufferings and my conflicts I do not mention, for I dare not! Owere I to paint to you the bitter struggles of a mind all at war withitself,--Duty, spirit, and fortitude, combating love, happinessand inclination,--each conquering alternately, and alternately eachvanquished,--I could endure it no longer, I resolved by one effort tofinish the strife, and to undergo an instant of even exquisite torture,in preference to a continuance of such lingering misery!ÓÒThe restoration of your health, Sir, and since you fancy it has beeninjured, of your happiness,Ó said Cecilia, Òwill, I hope, be as speedy,as I doubt not they are certain.ÓÒSince I fancy it has been injured!Ó repeated he; Òwhat a phrase, afteran avowal such as mine! But why should I wish to convince you of mysincerity, when to you it cannot be more indifferent, than to myself itis unfortunate! I have now only to entreat your pardon for the robbery Ihave committed upon your time, and to repeat my acknowledgments that youhave endeavoured to hear me with patience.ÓÒIf you honour me, Sir, with some portion of your esteem,Ó said theoffended Cecilia, Òthese acknowledgments, perhaps, should be mine;suppose them, however made, for I have a letter to write, and cantherefore stay no longer.ÓÒNor do I presume, madam,Ó cried he proudly, Òto detain you; hithertoyou may frequently have thought me mysterious, sometimes strange andcapricious, and perhaps almost always, unmeaning; to clear myself fromthese imputations, by a candid confession of the motives which havegoverned me, is all that I wished. Once, also--I hope but once,--youthought me impertinent,--there, indeed, I less dare vindicate myself--ÓÒThere is no occasion, Sir,Ó interrupted she, walking towards the door,Òfor further vindication in any thing; I am perfectly satisfied, and ifmy good wishes are worth your acceptance, assure yourself you possessthem.ÓÒBarbarous, and insulting!Ó cried he, half to himself; and then, with aquick motion hastening to open the door for her, ÒGo, madam,Ó he added,almost breathless with conflicting emotions, Ògo, and be your happinessunalterable as your inflexibility!ÓCecilia was turning back to answer this reproach, but the sight of LadyHonoria, who was entering at the other door, deterred her, and she wenton.When she came to her own room, she walked about it some time in a stateso unsettled, between anger and disappointment, sorrow and pride, thatshe scarce knew to which emotion to give way, and felt almost burstingwith each.ÒThe die,Ó she cried, Òis at last thrown; and this affair is concludedfor ever! Delvile himself is content to relinquish me; no father hascommanded, no mother has interfered, he has required no admonition,full well enabled to act for himself by the powerful instigation ofhereditary arrogance! Yet my family, he says,--unexpected condescension!my family and every other circumstance is unexceptionable; how feeble,then, is that regard which yields to one only objection! how potent thathaughtiness which to nothing will give way! Well, let him keep his name!since so wondrous its properties, so all-sufficient its preservation,what vanity, what presumption in me, to suppose myself an equivalent forits loss!ÓThus, deeply offended, her spirits were supported by resentment, and notonly while in company, but when alone, she found herself scarceaverse to the approaching separation, and enabled to endure it withoutrepining.CHAPTER x. -- A RETREAT.The next morning Cecilia arose late, not only to avoid the raillery ofLady Honoria, but to escape seeing the departure of Delvile; she knewthat the spirit with which she had left him, made him, at present,think her wholly insensible, and she was at least happy to be spared themortification of a discovery, since she found him thus content, withouteven solicitation, to resign her.Before she was dressed, Lady Honoria ran into her room, ÒA new scheme ofpolitics!Ó she cried; Òour great statesman intends to leave us; he can'ttrust his baby out of his sight, so he is going to nurse him while uponthe road himself. Poor pretty dear Mortimer! what a puppet do they makeof him! I have a vast inclination to get a pap-boat myself, and make hima present of it.ÓCecilia then enquired further particulars, and heard that Mr Delvilepurposed accompanying his son to Bristol, whose journey, therefore, waspostponed for a few hours to give time for new preparations.Mr Delvile, who, upon this occasion, thought himself overwhelmed withbusiness, because, before his departure, he had some directions to giveto his domestics, chose to breakfast in his own apartment; Mrs Delvile,also, wishing for some private conversation with her son, invited him topartake of hers in her dressing-room, sending an apology to her guests,and begging they would order their breakfasts when they pleased.Mr Delvile, scrupulous in ceremony, had made sundry apologies to LordErnolf for leaving him; but his real anxiety for his son overpoweringhis artificial character, the excuses he gave to that nobleman were suchas could not possibly offend; and the views of his lordship himself inhis visit, being nothing interrupted, so long as Cecilia continued atthe castle, he readily engaged, as a proof that he was not affronted, toremain with Mrs Delvile till his return.Cecilia, therefore, had her breakfast with the two lords and LadyHonoria; and when it was over, Lord Ernolf proposed to his son ridingthe first stage with the two Mr Delviles on horseback. This was agreedupon, and they left the room; and then Lady Honoria, full of frolic andgaiety, seized one of the napkins, and protested she would send it toMortimer for a slabbering-bib; she therefore made it up in a parcel, andwrote upon the inside of the paper with which she enveloped it, ÒA pin-afore for Master Mortimer Delvile, lest he should daub his pappy when heis feeding him.Ó Eager to have this properly conveyed, she then ran out,to give it in charge to her own man, who was to present him with it ashe got into the chaise.She had but just quitted the room, when the door of it was again opened,and by Mortimer himself, booted, and equipped for his journey.ÒMiss Beverley here! and alone!Ó cried he, with a look, and in a voice,which shewed that all the pride of the preceding evening was sunk intothe deepest dejection; Òand does she not fly as I approach her? can shepatiently bear in her sight one so strange, so fiery, so inconsistent?But she is too wise to resent the ravings of a madman;--and who, underthe influence of a passion at once hopeless and violent, can boast, butat intervals, full possession of his reason?ÓCecilia, utterly astonished by a gentleness so humble, looked at himin silent surprise; he advanced to her mournfully, and added, ÒI amashamed, indeed, of the bitterness of spirit with which I last nightprovoked your displeasure, when I should have supplicated your lenity;but though I was prepared for your coldness, I could not endure it, andthough your indifference was almost friendly, it made me little lessthan frantic; so strangely may justice be blinded by passion, and everyfaculty of reason be warped by selfishness!ÓÒYou have no apology to make, Sir,Ó cried Cecilia, Òsince, believe me, Irequire none.ÓÒYou may well,Ó returned he, half-smiling, Òdispense with my apologies,since under the sanction of that word, I obtained your hearingyesterday. But, believe me, you will now find me far more reasonable;a whole night's reflections--reflections which no reposeinterrupted!--have brought me to my senses. Even lunatics, you know,have lucid moments!ÓÒDo you intend, Sir, to set off soon?ÓÒI believe so; I wait only for my father. But why is Miss Beverley soimpatient? I shall not soon return; that, at least, is certain, and, fora few instants delay, may surely offer some palliation;--See! if I amnot ready to again accuse you of severity!--I must run, I find, or allmy boasted reformation will end but in fresh offence, fresh disgrace,and fresh contrition! Adieu, madam!--and may all prosperity attend you!That will be ever my darling wish, however long my absence, howeverdistant the climates which may part us!Ó He was then hurrying away,but Cecilia, from an impulse of surprise too sudden to be restrained,exclaimed ÒThe climates?--do you, then, mean to leave England?ÓÒYes,Ó cried he, with quickness, Òfor why should I remain in it? a fewweeks only could I fill up in any tour so near home, and hither in a fewweeks to return would be folly and madness; in an absence so brief, whatthought but that of the approaching meeting would occupy me? and what,at that meeting, should I feel, but joy the most dangerous, and delightwhich I dare not think of!--every conflict renewed, every strugglere-felt, again all this scene would require to be acted, again I musttear myself away, and every tumultuous passion now beating in myheart would be revived, and, if possible, be revived with addedmisery!--No!--neither my temper nor my constitution will endure suchanother shock, one parting shall suffice, and the fortitude with whichI will lengthen my self-exile, shall atone to myself for the weaknesswhich makes it requisite!ÓAnd then, with a vehemence that seemed fearful of the smallest delay, hewas again, and yet more hastily going, when Cecilia, with much emotion,called out, ÒTwo moments, Sir!ÓÒTwo thousand! two million!Ó cried he, impetuously, and returning, witha look of the most earnest surprise, he added, ÒWhat is it Miss Beverleywill condescend to command?ÓÒNothing,Ó cried she, recovering her presence of mind, Òbut to beg youwill by no means, upon my account, quit your country and your friends,since another asylum can be found for myself, and since I would muchsooner part from Mrs Delvile, greatly and sincerely as I reverence her,than be instrumental to robbing her, even for a month, of her son.ÓÒGenerous and humane is the consideration,Ó cried he; Òbut who half sogenerous, so humane as Miss Beverley? so soft to all others, so noble inherself? Can my mother have a wish, when I leave her with you? No; sheis sensible of your worth, she adores you, almost as I adore you myself!you are now under her protection, you seem, indeed, born for each other;let me not, then, deprive her of so honourable a charge--Oh, why musthe, who sees in such colours the excellencies of both, who admires withsuch fervour the perfections you unite, be torn with this violence fromthe objects he reveres, even though half his life he would sacrifice, tospend in their society what remained!Ó--ÒWell, then, Sir,Ó said Cecilia, who now felt her courage decline, andthe softness of sorrow steal fast upon her spirits, Òif you will notgive up your scheme, let me no longer detain you.ÓÒWill you not wish me a good journey?ÓÒYes,--very sincerely.ÓÒAnd will you pardon the unguarded errors which have offended you?ÓÒI will think of them, Sir, no more.ÓÒFarewell, then, most amiable of women, and may every blessing youdeserve light on your head! I leave to you my mother, certain of yoursympathetic affection for a character so resembling your own. When you,madam, leave her, may the happy successor in your favour--Ó He paused,his voice faultered, Cecilia, too, turned away from him, and, utteringa deep sigh, he caught her hand, and pressing it to his lips, exclaimed,ÒO great be your felicity, in whatever way you receive it!--pure asyour virtues, and warm as your benevolence!--Oh too lovely MissBeverley!--why, why must I quit you!ÓCecilia, though she trusted not her voice to reprove him, forced awayher hand, and then, in the utmost perturbation, he rushed out of theroom.This scene for Cecilia, was the most unfortunate that could havehappened; the gentleness of Delvile was alone sufficient to melt her,since her pride had no subsistence when not fed by his own; and whilehis mildness had blunted her displeasure, his anguish had penetrated herheart. Lost in thought and in sadness, she continued fixed to herseat; and looking at the door through which he had passed, as if, withhimself, he had shut out all for which she existed.This pensive dejection was not long uninterrupted; Lady Honoria camerunning back, with intelligence, in what manner she had disposed of hernapkin, and Cecilia in listening, endeavoured to find some diversion;but her ladyship, though volatile not undiscerning, soon perceived thather attention was constrained, and looking at her with much archness,said, ÒI believe, my dear, I must find another napkin for you! not, however, for your mouth, but for your eyes! Has Mortimer been in to takeleave of you?ÓÒTake leave of me?--No,--is he gone?ÓÒO no, Pappy has a world of business to settle first; he won't be readythese two hours. But don't look so sorrowful, for I'll run and bringMortimer to console you.ÓAway she flew, and Cecilia, who had no power to prevent her, finding herspirits unequal either to another parting, or to the raillery of LadyHonoria, should Mortimer, for his own sake, avoid it, took refugein flight, and seizing an umbrella, escaped into the park; where, toperplex any pursuers, instead of chusing her usual walk, she directedher steps to a thick and unfrequented wood, and never rested till shewas more than two miles from the house. Fidel, however, who nowalways accompanied her, ran by her side, and, when she thought herselfsufficiently distant and private to be safe, she sat down under a tree,and caressing her faithful favourite, soothed her own tenderness bylamenting that he had lost his master; and, having now no part to act,and no dignity to support, no observation to fear, and no inference toguard against, she gave vent to her long smothered emotions, by weepingwithout caution or restraint.She had met with an object whose character answered all her wishes forhim with whom she should entrust her fortune, and whose turn of mind, sosimilar to her own, promised her the highest domestic felicity; to thisobject her affections had involuntarily bent, they were seconded byesteem, and unchecked by any suspicion of impropriety in her choice;she had found too, in return, that his heart was all her own; her birth,indeed, was inferior, but it was not disgraceful; her disposition,education and temper seemed equal to his fondest wishes; yet, at thevery time when their union appeared most likely, when they mixed withthe same society, and dwelt under the same roof, when the father toone, was the guardian to the other, and interest seemed to invitetheir alliance even more than affection, the young man himself, withoutcounsel or command, could tear himself from her presence by an effortall his own, forbear to seek her heart, and almost charge her not togrant it, and determining upon voluntary exile, quit his country and hisconnections with no view, and for no reason, but merely that he mightavoid the sight of her he loved!Though the motive for this conduct was now no longer unknown to her, sheneither thought it satisfactory nor necessary; yet, while she censuredhis flight, she bewailed his loss, and though his inducement wasrepugnant to her opinion, his command over his passions she admired andapplauded.CHAPTER xi. -- A WORRY.Cecilia continued in this private spot, happy at least to be alone, tillshe was summoned by the dinner bell to return home.As soon as she entered the parlour, where every body was assembledbefore her, she observed, by the countenance of Mrs Delvile, that shehad passed the morning as sadly as herself.ÒMiss Beverley,Ó cried Lady Honoria, before she was seated, ÒI insistupon your taking my place to-day.ÓÒWhy so, madam?ÓÒBecause I cannot suffer you to sit by a window with such a terriblecold.ÓÒYour ladyship is very good, but indeed I have not any cold at all.ÓÒO my dear, I must beg your pardon there; your eyes are quite bloodshot;Mrs Delvile, Lord Ernolf, are not her eyes quite red?--Lord, and so Iprotest are her cheeks! now do pray look in the glass, I assure you youwill hardly know yourself.ÓMrs Delvile, who regarded her with the utmost kindness, affected tounderstand Lady Honoria's speech literally, both to lessen her apparentconfusion, and the suspicious surmises of Lord Ernolf; she thereforesaid, Òyou have indeed a bad cold, my love; but shade your eyes withyour hat, and after dinner you shall bathe them in rose water, whichwill soon take off the inflammation.ÓCecilia, perceiving her intention, for which she felt the utmostgratitude, no longer denied her cold, nor refused the offer of LadyHonoria; who, delighting in mischief, whencesoever it proceeded,presently added, ÒThis cold is a judgment upon you for leaving mealone all this morning; but I suppose you chose a tte--tte with yourfavourite, without the intrusion of any third person.ÓHere every body stared, and Cecilia very seriously declared she had beenquite alone.ÒIs it possible you can so forget yourself?Ó cried Lady Honoria; Òhadyou not your dearly beloved with you?ÓCecilia, who now comprehended that she meant Fidel, coloured more deeplythan ever, but attempted to laugh, and began eating her dinner.ÒHere seems some matter of much intricacy,Ó cried Lord Ernolf, Òbut, tome, wholly unintelligible.ÓÒAnd to me also,Ó cried Mrs Delvile, Òbut I am content to let it remainso; for the mysteries of Lady Honoria are so frequent, that they deadencuriosity.ÓÒDear madam, that is very unnatural,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òfor I am sureyou must long to know who I mean.ÓÒI do, at least,Ó said Lord Ernolf.ÒWhy then, my lord, you must know, Miss Beverley has two companions,and I am one, and Fidel is the other; but Fidel was with her all thismorning, and she would not admit me to the conference. I suppose she hadsomething private to say to him of his master's journey.ÓÒWhat rattle is this?Ó cried Mrs Delvile; ÒFidel is gone with my son, ishe not?Ó turning to the servants.ÒNo, madam, Mr Mortimer did not enquire for him.ÓÒThat's very strange,Ó said she, ÒI never knew him quit home without himbefore.ÓÒDear ma'am, if he had taken him,Ó cried Lady Honoria, Òwhat could poorMiss Beverley have done? for she has no friend here but him and me, andreally he's so much the greater favourite, that it is well if I do notpoison him some day for very spite.ÓCecilia had no resource but in forcing a laugh, and Mrs Delvile, whoevidently felt for her, contrived soon to change the subject; yet notbefore Lord Ernolf, with infinite chagrin, was certain by all thatpassed of the hopeless state of affairs for his son.The rest of the day, and every hour of the two days following, Ceciliapassed in the most comfortless constraint, fearful of being a momentalone, lest the heaviness of her heart should seek relief in tears,which consolation, melancholy as it was, she found too dangerousfor indulgence; yet the gaiety of Lady Honoria lost all power ofentertainment, and even the kindness of Mrs Delvile, now she imputed itto compassion, gave her more mortification than pleasure.On the third day, letters arrived from Bristol; but they brought withthem nothing of comfort, for though Mortimer wrote gaily, his fathersent word that his fever seemed threatening to return.Mrs Delvile was now in the extremest anxiety; and the task of Ceciliain appearing chearful and unconcerned, became more and more difficultto perform. Lord Ernolf's efforts to oblige her grew as hopeless tohimself, as they were irksome to her; and Lady Honoria alone, of thewhole house, could either find or make the smallest diversion. But whileLord Derford remained, she had still an object for ridicule, and whileCecilia could colour and be confused, she had still a subject formischief.Thus passed a week, during which the news from Bristol being every dayless and less pleasant, Mrs Delvile shewed an earnest desire to make ajourney thither herself, and proposed, half laughing and half seriously,that the whole party should accompany her.Lady Honoria's time, however, was already expired, and her fatherintended to send for her in a few days.Mrs Delvile, who knew that such a charge would occupy all her time,willingly deferred setting out till her ladyship should be gone, butwrote word to Bristol that she should shortly be there, attended by thetwo lords, who insisted upon escorting her.Cecilia now was in a state of the utmost distress; her stay at thecastle she knew kept Delvile at a distance; to accompany his mother toBristol, was forcing herself into his sight, which equally from prudenceand pride she wished to avoid; and even Mrs Delvile evidently desiredher absence, since whenever the journey was talked of, she preferablyaddressed herself to any one else who was present.All she could devise to relieve herself from a situation so painful, wasbegging permission to make a visit without delay to her old friend MrsCharlton in Suffolk.This resolution taken, she put it into immediate execution, and seekingMrs Delvile, enquired if she might venture to make a petition to her?ÒUndoubtedly,Ó answered she; Òbut let it not be very disagreeable, sinceI feel already that I can refuse you nothing.ÓÒI have an old friend, ma'am,Ó she then cried, speaking fast, and inmuch haste to have done, Òwho I have not for many months seen, and, asmy health does not require a Bristol journey,--if you would honourme with mentioning my request to Mr Delvile, I think I might take thepresent opportunity of making Mrs Charlton a visit.ÓMrs Delvile looked at her some time without speaking, and then,fervently embracing her, Òsweet Cecilia!Ó she cried, Òyes, you areall that I thought you! good, wise, discreet, tender, and noble atonce!--how to part with you, indeed, I know not,--but you shall do asyou please, for that I am sure will be right, and therefore I will makeno opposition.ÓCecilia blushed and thanked her, yet saw but too plainly that allthe motives of her scheme were clearly comprehended. She hastened,therefore, to write to Mrs Charlton, and prepare for her reception.Mr Delvile, though with his usual formality, sent his permission; andMortimer at the same time, begged his mother would bring with her Fidel,whom he had unluckily forgotten.Lady Honoria, who was present when Mrs Delvile mentioned thiscommission, said in a whisper to Cecilia, ÒMiss Beverley, don't let himgo.ÓÒWhy not?ÓÒO, you had a great deal better take him slyly into Suffolk.ÓÒI would as soon,Ó answered Cecilia, Òtake with me the side-board ofplate, for I should scarcely think it more a robbery.ÓÒOh, I beg your pardon, I am sure they might all take such a theft foran honour; and if I was going to Bristol, I would bid Mortimer send himto you immediately. However, if you wish it, I will write to him. He'smy cousin, you know, so there will be no great impropriety in it.ÓCecilia thanked her for so courteous an offer, but entreated that shemight by no means draw her into such a condescension.She then made immediate preparations for her journey into Suffolk,which she saw gave equal surprize and chagrin to Lord Ernolf, upon whoseaffairs Mrs Delvile herself now desired to speak with her.ÒTell me, Miss Beverley,Ó she cried, Òbriefly and positively youropinion of Lord Derford?ÓÒI think of him so little, madam,Ó she answered, Òthat I cannot say ofhim much; he appears, however, to be inoffensive; but, indeed, were Inever to see him again, he is one of those I should forget I had everseen at all.ÓÒThat is so exactly the case with myself also,Ó cried Mrs Delvile, Òthatto plead for him, I find utterly impossible, though my Lord Ernolf hasstrongly requested me; but to press such an alliance, I should think anindignity to your understanding.ÓCecilia was much gratified by this speech; but she soon after added,ÒThere is one reason, indeed, which would render such a connectiondesirable, though that is only one.ÓÒWhat is it, madam?ÓÒHis title.ÓÒAnd why so? I am sure I have no ambition of that sort.ÓÒNo, my love,Ó said Mrs Delvile, smiling, ÒI mean not by way ofgratification to your pride, but to his; since a title, by taking placeof a family name, would obviate the only objection that any man couldform to an alliance with Miss Beverley.ÓCecilia, who too well understood her, suppressed a sigh, and changed thesubject of conversation.One day was sufficient for all the preparations she required, and, asshe meant to set out very early the next morning, she took leave of LadyHonoria, and the Lords Ernolf and Derford, when they separated for thenight; but Mrs Delvile followed her to her room.She expressed her concern at losing her in the warmest and mostflattering terms, yet said nothing of her coming back, nor of the lengthof her stay; she desired, however, to hear from her frequently, andassured her that out of her own immediate family, there was nobody inthe world she so tenderly valued.She continued with her till it grew so late that they were almostnecessarily parted; and then rising to be gone, ÒSee,Ó she cried, Òwithwhat reluctance I quit you! no interest but so dear a one as that whichcalls me away, should induce me, with my own consent, to bear yourabsence scarcely an hour; but the world is full of mortifications, andto endure, or to sink under them, makes all the distinction between thenoble or the weak-minded. To you this may be said with safety; to mostyoung women it would pass for a reflection.ÓÒYou are very good,Ó said Cecilia, smothering the emotions to whichthis speech gave rise, Òand if indeed you honour me with an opinionso flattering, I will endeavour, if it is possibly in my power, not toforfeit it.ÓÒAh, my love!Ó cried Mrs Delvile warmly, Òif upon my opinion of youalone depended our residence with each other, when should we ever part,and how live a moment asunder? But what title have I to monopolize twosuch blessings? the mother of Mortimer Delvile should at nothing repine;the mother of Cecilia Beverley had alone equal reason to be proud.ÓÒYou are determined, madam,Ó said Cecilia, forcing a smile, Òthat Ishall be worthy, by giving me the sweetest of motives, that of deservingsuch praise.Ó And then, in a faint voice, she desired her respects to MrDelvile, and added, Òyou will find, I hope, every body at Bristol betterthan you expect.ÓÒI hope so,Ó returned she; Òand that you too, will find your MrsCharlton well, happy, and good as you left her; but suffer her not todrive me from your remembrance, and never fancy that because she hasknown you longer, she loves you more; my acquaintance with you,though short, has been critical, and she must hear from you a world ofanecdotes, before she can have reason to love you as much.ÓÒAh, madam,Ó cried Cecilia, tears starting into her eyes, Òlet us partnow!--where will be that strength of mind you expect from me, if Ilisten to you any longer!ÓÒYou are right, my love,Ó answered Mrs Delvile, Òsince all tendernessenfeebles fortitude.Ó Then affectionately embracing her, ÒAdieu,Ó she cried, Òsweetest Cecilia, amiable and most excellent creature,adieu!--you, carry with you my highest approbation, my love, my esteem,my fondest wishes!--and shall I--yes, generous girl! I will add mywarmest gratitude!ÓThis last word she spoke almost in a whisper, again kissed her, andhastened out of the room.Cecilia, surprised and affected, gratified and depressed, remainedalmost motionless, and could not, for a great length of time, eitherring for her maid, or persuade herself to go to rest. She saw throughoutthe whole behaviour of Mrs Delvile, a warmth of regard which, thoughstrongly opposed by family pride, made her almost miserable to promotethe very union she thought necessary to discountenance; she saw, too,that it was with the utmost difficulty she preserved the steadiness ofher opposition, and that she had a conflict perpetual with herself,to forbear openly acknowledging the contrariety of her wishes, andthe perplexity of her distress; but chiefly she was struck withher expressive use of the word gratitude. ÒWherefore should she begrateful,Ó thought Cecilia, Òwhat have I done, or had power to do?infinitely, indeed, is she deceived, if she supposes that her son hasacted by my directions; my influence with him is nothing, and he couldnot be more his own master, were he utterly indifferent to me. Toconceal my own disappointment has, been all I have attempted; andperhaps she may think of me thus highly, from supposing that thefirmness of her son is owing to my caution and reserve; ah, she knowshim not!--were my heart at this moment laid open to him,--were all itsweakness, its partiality, its ill-fated admiration displayed, he wouldbut double his vigilance to avoid and forget me, and find the taskall the easier by his abatement of esteem. Oh strange infatuation ofunconquerable prejudice! his very life will he sacrifice in preferenceto his name, and while the conflict of his mind threatens to levelhim with the dust, he disdains to unite himself where one wish isunsatisfied!ÓThese reflections, and the uncertainty if she should ever in DelvileCastle sleep again, disturbed her the whole night, and made all callingin the morning unnecessary; she arose at five o'clock, dressed herselfwith the utmost heaviness of heart, and in going through a long gallerywhich led to the staircase, as she passed the door of Mortimer'schamber, the thought of his ill health, his intended long journey, andthe probability that she might never see him more, so deeply impressedand saddened her, that scarcely could she force herself to proceed,without stopping to weep and to pray for him; she was surrounded,however, by servants, and compelled therefore to hasten to the chaise;she flung herself in, and, leaning back, drew her hat over her eyes, andthought, as the carriage drove off, her last hope of earthly happinessextinguished.BOOK VII.CHAPTER i. -- A RENOVATION.Cecilia was accompanied by her maid in the chaise, and her own servantand one of Mrs Delvile's attended her on horseback.The quietness of her dejection was soon interrupted by a loud cryamong the men of Òhome! home! home!Ó She then looked out of one of thewindows, and perceived Fidel, running after the carriage, and barking atthe servants, who were all endeavouring to send him back.Touched by this proof of the animal's gratitude for her attention tohim, and conscious she had herself occasioned his master's leaving him,the scheme of Lady Honoria occurred to her, and she almost wished to putit in execution, but this was the thought of a moment, and motioning himwith her hand to go back, she desired Mrs Delvile's man to return withhim immediately, and commit him to the care of somebody in the castle.This little incident, however trifling, was the most important of herjourney, for she arrived at the house of Mrs Charlton without meetingany other.The sight of that lady gave her a sensation of pleasure to which shehad long been a stranger, pleasure pure, unmixed, unaffected andunrestrained; it revived all her early affection, and with it, somethingresembling at least her early tranquility; again she was in the housewhere it had once been undisturbed, again she enjoyed the society whichwas once all she had wished, and again saw the same scene, the samefaces, and same prospects she had beheld while her heart was all devotedto her friends.Mrs Charlton, though old and infirm, preserved an understanding, which,whenever unbiassed by her affections, was sure to direct her unerringly;but the extreme softness of her temper frequently misled her judgment,by making it, at the pleasure either of misfortune or of artifice,always yield to compassion, and pliant to entreaty. Where her counseland opinion were demanded, they were certain to reflect honour on hercapacity and discernment; but where her assistance or her pity weresupplicated, her purse and her tears were immediately bestowed, and inher zeal to alleviate distress she forgot if the object were deservingher solicitude, and stopt not to consider propriety or discretion, ifhappiness, however momentary, were in her power to grant.This generous foible was, however, kept somewhat in subjection by thewatchfulness of two grand-daughters, who, fearing the injury theymight themselves receive from it, failed not to point out both itsinconvenience and its danger.These ladies were daughters of a deceased and only son of Mrs Charlton;they were single, and lived with their grand-mother, whose fortune,which was considerable, they expected to share between them, and theywaited with eagerness for the moment of appropriation; narrow-minded andrapacious, they wished to monopolize whatever she possessed, and thoughtthemselves aggrieved by her smallest donations. Their chief employmentwas to keep from her all objects of distress, and in this though theycould not succeed, they at least confined her liberality to such asresembled themselves; since neither the spirited could brook, nor thedelicate support the checks and rebuffs from the granddaughters, whichfollowed the gifts of Mrs Charlton. Cecilia, of all her acquaintance,was the only one whose intimacy they encouraged, for they knew herfortune made her superior to any mercenary views, and they received fromher themselves more civilities than they paid.Mrs Charlton loved Cecilia with an excess of fondness, that not onlytook place of the love she bore her other friends, but to which even herregard for the Miss Charltons was inferior and feeble. Cecilia when achild had reverenced her as a mother, and, grateful for her tendernessand care, had afterwards cherished her as a friend. The revival of thisearly connection delighted them both, it was balm to the wounded mind ofCecilia, it was renovation to the existence of Mrs Charlton.Early the next morning she wrote a card to Mr Monckton and LadyMargaret, acquainting them with her return into Suffolk, and desiring toknow when she might pay her respects to her Ladyship. She received fromthe old lady a verbal answer, when she pleased, but Mr Monckton cameinstantly himself to Mrs Charlton's.His astonishment, his rapture at this unexpected incident were almostboundless; he thought it a sudden turn of fortune in his own favour, andconcluded, now she had escaped the danger of Delvile Castle, the roadwas short and certain that led to his own security.Her satisfaction in the meeting was as sincere, though not so animatedas his own; but this similarity in their feelings was of short duration,for when he enquired into what had passed at the castle, with thereasons of her quitting it, the pain she felt in giving even a cursoryand evasive account, was opposed on his part by the warmest delight inhearing it; he could not obtain from her the particulars of whathad happened, but the reluctance with which she spoke, the air ofmortification with which she heard his questions, and the evidentdispleasure which was mingled in her chagrin, when he forced her tomention Delvile, were all proofs the most indisputable and satisfactory,that they had either parted without any explanation, or with one bywhich Cecilia had been hurt and offended.He now readily concluded that since the fiery trial he had mostapprehended was over; and she had quitted in anger the asylum she hadsought in extacy, Delvile himself did not covet the alliance, which,since they were separated, was never likely to take place. He hadtherefore little difficulty in promising all success to himself.She was once more upon the spot where she had regarded him as thefirst of men, he knew that during her absence no one had settled inthe neighbourhood who had any pretensions to dispute with him thatpre-eminence, he should again have access to her, at pleasure, and sosanguine grew his hopes, that he almost began to rejoice even in thepartiality to Delvile that had hitherto been his terror, from believingit would give her for a time, that sullen distaste of all otherconnections, to which those who at once are delicate and fervent arecommonly led by early disappointment. His whole solicitude thereforenow was to preserve her esteem, to seek her confidence, and to regainwhatever by absence might be lost of the [ascendancy] over her mindwhich her respect for his knowledge and capacity had for many yearsgiven him. Fortune at this time seemed to prosper all his views, and,by a stroke the most sudden and unexpected, to render more rationalhis hopes and his plans than he had himself been able to effect by theutmost craft of worldly wisdom.The day following Cecilia, in Mrs Charlton's chaise, waited upon LadyMargaret. She was received by Miss Bennet, her companion, with the mostfawning courtesy; but when conducted to the lady of the house, she sawherself so evidently unwelcome, that she even regretted the civilitywhich had prompted her visit.She found with her nobody but Mr Morrice, who was the only young manthat could persuade himself to endure her company in the absence of herhusband, but who, in common with most young men who are assiduous intheir attendance upon old ladies, doubted not but he ensured himself ahandsome legacy for his trouble.Almost the first speech which her ladyship made, was ÒSo you are notmarried yet, I find; if Mr Monckton had been a real friend, he wouldhave taken care to have seen for some establishment for you.ÓÒI was by no means,Ó cried Cecilia, with spirit, Òeither in so muchhaste or distress as to require from Mr Monckton any such exertion ofhis friendship.ÓÒMa'am,Ó cried Morrice, Òwhat a terrible night we had of it at Vauxhall!poor Harrel! I was really excessively sorry for him. I had not courageto see you or Mrs Harrel after it. But as soon as I heard you were inSt James's-square, I tried to wait upon you; for really going to MrHarrel's again would have been quite too dismal. I would rather have runa mile by the side of a race-horse.ÓÒThere is no occasion for any apology,Ó said Cecilia, Òfor I was verylittle disposed either to see or think of visitors.ÓÒSo I thought, ma'am;Ó answered he, with quickness, Òand really thatmade me the less alert in finding you out. However, ma'am, next winterI shall be excessively happy to make up for the deficiency; besides, Ishall be much obliged to you to introduce me to Mr Delvile, for I have agreat desire to be acquainted with him.ÓMr Delvile, thought Cecilia, would be but too proud to hear it! However,she merely answered that she had no present prospect of spending anytime at Mr. Delvile's next winter.ÒTrue, ma'am, true,Ó cried he, Ònow I recollect, you become your ownmistress between this and then; and so I suppose you will naturallychuse a house of your own, which will be much more eligible.ÓÒI don't think that,Ó said Lady Margaret, ÒI never saw anything eligiblecome of young women's having houses of their own; she will do a muchbetter thing to marry, and have some proper person to take care of her.ÓÒNothing more right, ma'am!Ó returned he; Òa young lady in a houseby herself must be subject to a thousand dangers. What sort of place,ma'am, has Mr Delvile got in the country? I hear he has a good deal ofground there, and a large house.ÓÒIt is an old castle, Sir, and situated in a park.ÓÒThat must be terribly forlorn; I dare say, ma'am, you were very happyto return into Suffolk.ÓÒI did not find it forlorn; I was very well satisfied with it.ÓÒWhy, indeed, upon second thoughts, I don't much wonder; an old castlein a large park must make a very romantic appearance; something noble init, I dare say.ÓÒAye,Ó cried Lady Margaret, Òthey said you were to become mistress ofit, and marry Mr Delvile's son and I cannot, for my own part, see anyobjection to it.ÓÒI am told of so many strange reports,Ó said Cecilia, Òand all, tomyself so unaccountable, that I begin now to hear of them without muchwonder.ÓÒThat's a charming young man, I believe,Ó said Morrice; ÒI had thepleasure once or twice of meeting him at poor Harrel's, and he seemedmighty agreeable. Is not he so, ma'am?ÓÒYes,--I believe so.ÓÒNay, I don't mean to speak of him as any thing very extraordinary,Ó cried Morrice, imagining her hesitation proceeded from dislike, ÒImerely meant as the world goes,--in a common sort of a way.ÓHere they were joined by Mr Monckton and some gentlemen who were on avisit at his house; for his anxiety was not of a sort to lead him tosolitude, nor his disposition to make him deny himself any kind ofenjoyment which he had power to attain. A general conversation ensued,which lasted till Cecilia ended her visit; Mr Monckton then took herhand to lead her to the chaise, but told her, in their way out, of somealterations in his grounds, which he desired to shew her; his viewof detaining her was to gather what she thought of her reception, andwhether she had yet any suspicions of the jealousy of Lady Margaret;well knowing, from the delicacy of her character, that if once shebecame acquainted with it, she would scrupulously avoid all intercoursewith him, from the fear of encreasing her uneasiness.He began, therefore, with talking of the pleasure which Lady Margarettook in the plantations, and of his hope that Cecilia would often favourher by visiting them, without waiting to have her visits returned, asshe was entitled by her infirmities to particular indulgencies. He wascontinuing in this strain, receiving from Cecilia hardly any answer,when suddenly from behind a thick laurel bush, jumpt up Mr Morrice; whohad run out of the house by a shorter cut, and planted himself there tosurprise them.ÒSo ho!Ó cried he with a loud laugh, ÒI have caught you! This will be afine anecdote for Lady Margaret; I vow I'll tell her.ÓMr Monckton, never off his guard, readily answered ÒAye, prithee do,Morrice; but don't omit to relate also what we said of yourself.ÓÒOf me?Ó cried he, with some eagerness; Òwhy you never mentioned me.ÓÒO that won't pass, I assure you; we shall tell another tale at table byand by; and bring the old proverb of the ill luck of listeners upon youin its full force.ÓÒWell, I'll be hanged if I know what you mean!ÓÒWhy you won't pretend you did not hear Miss Beverley say you were thetruest Ouran Outang, or man-monkey, she ever knew?ÓÒNo, indeed, that I did not!ÒNo?--Nor how much she admired your dexterity in escaping beinghorse-whipt three times a day for your incurable impudence?ÓÒNot a word on't! Horse-whipt!--Miss Beverley, pray did you say any suchthing?ÓÒAy,Ó cried Monckton, again, Òand not only horse-whipt, buthorse-ponded, for she thought when, one had heated, the other might coolyou; and then you might be fitted again for your native woods, forshe insists upon it you was brought from Africa, and are not yet halftamed.ÓÒO Lord!Ó cried Morrice, amazed, ÒI should not have suspected MissBeverley would have talked so!ÓÒAnd do you suspect she did now?Ó cried Cecilia.ÒPho, pho,Ó cried Monckton, coolly, Òwhy he heard it himself the wholetime! and so shall all our party by and bye, if I can but remember tomention it.ÓCecilia then returned to the chaise, leaving Mr Monckton to settle thematter with his credulous guest as he pleased; for supposing he wasmerely gratifying a love of sport, or taking this method of checking thegeneral forwardness of the young man, she forbore any interferencethat might mar his intention. But Mr Monckton loved not to be ralliedconcerning Cecilia, though he was indifferent to all that could be saidto him of any other woman; he meant, therefore, to intimidate Morricefrom renewing the subject; and he succeeded to his wish; poor Morrice,whose watching and whose speech were the mere blunders of chance,made without the slightest suspicion of Mr Monckton's designs, nowapprehended some scheme to render himself ridiculous, and though hedid not believe Cecilia had made use of such expressions, he fancied MrMonckton meant to turn the laugh against him, and determined, therefore,to say nothing that might remind him of what had passed.Mr Monckton had at this time admitted him to his house merely from anexpectation of finding more amusement in his blundering and giddiness,than he was capable, during his anxiety concerning Cecilia, of receivingfrom conversation of an higher sort. The character of Morrice was,indeed, particularly adapted for the entertainment of a large house inthe country; eager for sport, and always ready for enterprize; willingto oblige, yet tormented with no delicacy about offending; the first topromote mischief for any other, and the last to be offended when exposedto it himself; gay, thoughtless, and volatile,-a happy composition oflevity and good-humour.Cecilia, however, to quitting the house, determined not to visit itagain very speedily; for she was extremely disgusted with Lady Margaret,though she suspected no particular motives of enmity, against whichshe was guarded alike by her own unsuspicious innocence, and by an highesteem of Mr Monckton, which she firmly believed he returned with equalhonesty of undesigning friendship.Her next excursion was to visit Mrs Harrel; she found that unhappy ladya prey to all the misery of unoccupied solitude; torn from whatever had,to her, made existence seem valuable, her mind was as listless as herperson was inactive, and she was at a loss how to employ even a momentof the day; she had now neither a party to form, nor an entertainment toplan, company to arrange, nor dress to consider; and these, with visitsand public places, had filled all her time since her marriage, which,as it had happened very early in her life, had merely taken place ofgirlish amusements, masters and governesses.This helplessness of insipidity, however, though naturally the effectof a mind devoid of all genuine resources, was dignified by herself withthe appellation of sorrow; nor was this merely a screen to the world;unused to investigate her feelings or examine her heart, the generalcompassion she met for the loss of her husband, persuaded her thatindeed she lamented his destiny; though had no change in her life beencaused by his suicide, she would scarcely, when the first shock wasover, have thought of it again.She received Cecilia with great pleasure; and with still greater, heardthe renewal of her promises to fit up a room for her in her house, assoon as she came of age; a period which now was hardly a month distant.Far greater, however, as well as infinitely purer, was the joy which herpresence bestowed upon Mr Arnott; she saw it herself with a sensation ofregret, not only at the constant passion which occasioned it, but evenat her own inability to participate in or reward it for with him analliance would meet with no opposition; his character was amiable,his situation in life unexceptionable; he loved her with the tenderestaffection, and no pride, she well knew, would interfere to overpower it;yet, in return, to grant him her love, she felt as utterly impossibleas to refuse him her esteem; and the superior attractions of Delvile, ofwhich neither displeasure nor mortification could rob him, shut up herheart, for the present, more firmly than ever, as Mr Monckton had wellimagined, to all other assailants. Yet she by no means weakly gave wayto repining or regret; her suspence was at an end, her hopes and herfears were subsided into certainty; Delvile, in quitting her, hadacquainted her that he had left her for ever, and even, though not,indeed, with much steadiness, had prayed for her happiness in union withsome other; she held it therefore as essential to her character as toher peace, to manifest equal fortitude in subduing her partiality; sheforbore to hint to Mrs Charlton what had passed, that the subject mightnever be started; allowed herself no time for dangerous recollection;strolled in her old walks, and renewed her old acquaintance, and bya vigorous exertion of active wisdom, doubted not compleating, beforelong, the subjection of her unfortunate tenderness. Nor was her taskso difficult as she had feared; resolution, in such cases, may act theoffice of time, and anticipate by reason and self-denial, what that,much less nobly, effects through forgetfulness and inconstancy.CHAPTER ii. -- A VISIT.One week only, however, had yet tried the perseverance of Cecilia, when,while she was working with Mrs Charlton in her dressing-room, her maidhastily entered it, and with a smile that seemed announcing welcomenews, said, ÒLord, ma'am, here's Fidel!Ó and, at the same moment,she was followed by the dog, who jumpt upon Cecilia in a transport ofdelight.ÒGood heaven,Ó cried she, all amazement, Òwho has brought him? whencedoes he come?ÓÒA country man brought him, ma'am; but he only put him in, and would notstay a minute.ÓÒBut whom did he enquire for?--who saw him?--what did he say?ÓÒHe saw Ralph, ma'am.ÓRalph, then, was instantly called; and these questions being repeated,he said, ÒMa'am, it was a man I never saw before; but he only bid metake care to deliver the dog into your own hands, and said you wouldhave a letter about him soon, and then went away; I wanted him to staytill I came up stairs, but he was off at once.ÓCecilia, quite confounded by this account, could make neither commentnor answer; but, as soon as the servants had left the room, Mrs Charltonentreated to know to whom the dog had belonged, convinced by her extremeagitation, that something interesting and uncommon must relate to him.This was no time for disguise; astonishment and confusion bereft Ceciliaof all power to attempt it; and, after a very few evasions, she brieflycommunicated her situation with respect to Delvile, his leaving her,his motives, and his mother's evident concurrence; for these were all soconnected with her knowledge of Fidel, that she led to them unavoidablyin telling what she knew of him.Very little penetration was requisite, to gather from her manner allthat was united in her narrative of her own feelings and disappointmentin the course of this affair; and Mrs Charlton, who had hithertobelieved the whole world at her disposal, and that she continued singlefrom no reason but her own difficulty of choice, was utterly amazed tofind that any man existed who could withstand the united allurementsof so much beauty, sweetness, and fortune. She felt herself sometimesinclined to hate, and at other times to pity him; yet concluded that herown extreme coldness was the real cause of his flight, and warmly blameda reserve which had thus ruined her happiness.Cecilia was in the extremest perplexity and distress to conjecturethe meaning of so unaccountable a present, and so strange a message.Delvile, she knew, had desired the dog might follow him to Bristol; hismother, always pleased to oblige him, would now less than ever neglectany opportunity; she could not, therefore, doubt that she had sent ortaken him thither, and thence, according to all appearances, he mustnow come. But was it likely Delvile would take such a liberty? Was itprobable, when so lately he had almost exhorted her to forget him, hewould even wish to present her with such a remembrance of himself? Andwhat was the letter she was bid to expect? Whence and from what was itto come?All was inexplicable! the only thing she could surmise, with anysemblance of probability, was that the whole was some frolic of LadyHonoria Pemberton, who had persuaded Delvile to send her the dog, andperhaps assured him she had herself requested to have him.Provoked by this suggestion, her first thought was instantly having himconveyed to the castle; but uncertain what the whole affair meant, andhoping some explanation in the letter she was promised, she determinedto wait till it came, or at least till she heard from Mrs Delvile,before she took any measures herself in the business. Mutual accountsof their safe arrivals at Bristol and in Suffolk, had already passedbetween them, and she expected very soon to have further intelligence;though she was now, by the whole behaviour of Mrs Delvile, convinced shewished not again to have her an inmate of her house, and that the restof her minority might pass, without opposition; in the house of MrsCharlton.Day after day, however, passed, and yet she heard nothing more; a week,a fortnight elapsed, and still no letter came. She now concluded thepromise was a deception, and repented that she had waited a momentwith any such expectation. Her peace, during this time, was greatlydisturbed; this present made her fear she was thought meanly of byMr Delvile; the silence of his mother gave her apprehensions for hishealth, and her own irresolution how to act, kept her in perpetualinquietude. She tried in vain to behave as if this incident had nothappened; her mind was uneasy, and the same actions produced not thesame effects; when she now worked or read, the sight of Fidel by herside distracted her attention; when she walked, it was the same, forFidel always followed her; and though, in visiting her old acquaintance,she forbore to let him accompany her, she was secretly planning thewhole time the contents of some letter, which she expected to meet with,on returning to Mrs Charlton's.Those gentlemen in the country who, during the life-time of the Dean,had paid their addresses to Cecilia, again waited upon her at MrsCharlton's, and renewed their proposals. They had now, however, stillless chance of success, and their dismission was brief and decisive.Among these came Mr Biddulph; and to him Cecilia was involuntarilymost civil, because she knew him to be the friend of Delvile. Yethis conversation encreased the uneasiness of her suspence; for afterspeaking of the family in general which she had left, he enquired moreparticularly concerning Delvile, and then added, ÒI am, indeed, greatlygrieved to find, by all the accounts I receive of him, that he is now ina very bad state of health.ÓThis speech gave her fresh subject for apprehension; and in proportionas the silence of Mrs Delvile grew more alarming, her regard for herfavourite Fidel became more partial. The affectionate animal seemed tomourn the loss of his master, and while sometimes she indulged herselfin fancifully telling him her fears, she imagined she read in hiscountenance the faithfullest sympathy.One week of her minority was now all that remained, and she was soonwholly occupied in preparations for coming of age. She purposed takingpossession of a large house that had belonged to her uncle, which wassituated only three miles from that of Mrs Charlton; and she employedherself in giving orders for fitting it up, and in hearing complaints,and promising indulgencies, to various of her tenants.At this time, while she was at breakfast one morning, a letter arrivedfrom Mrs Delvile. She apologised for not writing sooner, but added thatvarious family occurrences, which had robbed her of all leisure, mighteasily be imagined, when she acquainted her that Mortimer had determinedupon again going abroad.... They were all, she said, returned to DelvileCastle, but mentioned nothing either of the health of her son, or of herown regret, and filled up the rest of her letter, with general news andexpressions of kindness; though, in a postscript, was inserted, ÒWe havelost our poor Fidel.ÓCecilia was still meditating upon this letter, by which her perplexityhow to act was rather encreased than diminished, when, to her greatsurprise, Lady Honoria Pemberton was announced. She hastily begged oneof the Miss Charltons to convey Fidel out of sight, from a dread of herraillery, should she, at last, be unconcerned in the transaction, andthen went to receive her.Lady Honoria, who was with her governess, gave a brief history of herquitting Delvile Castle, and said she was now going with her father tovisit a noble family in Norfolk; but she had obtained his permissionto leave him at the inn where they had slept, in order to make a shortexcursion to Bury, for the pleasure of seeing Miss Beverley.ÒAnd therefore,Ó she continued, ÒI can stay but half an hour; so youmust give me some account of yourself as fast as possible.ÓÒWhat account does your ladyship require?ÓÒWhy, who you live with here, and who are your companions, and what youdo with yourself.ÓÒWhy, I live with Mrs Charlton; and for companions, I have at least ascore; here are her two grand-daughters, and Mrs and Miss--.ÓÒPho, pho,Ó interrupted Lady Honoria, Òbut I don't mean such hum-drumcompanions as those; you'll tell me next, I suppose, of the parson andhis wife and three daughters, with all their cousins and aunts; Ihate those sort of people. What I desire to hear of is, who are yourparticular favourites; and whether you take long walks here, as youused to do at the Castle, and who you have to accompany you?Ó And then,looking at her very archly, she added, ÒA pretty little dog, now, Ishould think, would be vastly agreeable in such a place as this.--Ah,Miss Beverley! you have not left off that trick of colouring, I see!ÓÒIf I colour now,Ó said Cecilia, fully convinced of the justness of hersuspicions, ÒI think it must be for your ladyship, not myself; for, ifI am not much mistaken, either in person, or by proxy, a blush from LadyHonoria Pemberton would not, just now, be wholly out of season.ÓÒLord,Ó cried she, Òhow like that is to a speech of Mrs Delvile's!She has taught you exactly her manner of talking. But do you know I aminformed you have got Fidel with you here? O fie, Miss Beverley! Whatwill papa and mamma say, when they find you have taken away poor littlemaster's plaything?ÓÒAnd O fie, Lady Honoria! what shall I say, when I find you guilty ofthis mischievous frolic! I must beg, however, since you have gone thusfar, that you will proceed a little farther, and send back the dog tothe person from whom you received him.ÓÒNo, not I! manage him all your own way; if you chuse to accept dogsfrom gentlemen, you know, it is your affair, and not mine.ÓÒIf you really will not return him yourself, you must at least pardon meshould you hear that I do in your ladyship's name.ÓLady Honoria for some time only laughed and rallied, without comingto any explanation; but when she had exhausted all the sport she couldmake, she frankly owned that she had herself ordered the dog to beprivately stolen, and then sent a man with him to Mrs Charlton's.ÒBut you know,Ó she continued, ÒI really owed you a spite for being soill-natured as to run away after sending me to call Mortimer to comfortand take leave of you.ÓÒDo you dream, Lady Honoria? when did I send you?ÓÒWhy you know you looked as if you wished it, and that was the samething. But really it made me appear excessively silly, when I had forcedhim to come back with me, and told him you were waiting for him,--to seenothing of you at all, and not be able to find or trace you. He took itall for my own invention.ÓÒAnd was it not your own invention?ÓÒWhy that's nothing to the purpose; I wanted him to believe you sent me,for I knew else he would not come.ÓÒYour ladyship was a great deal too good!ÓÒWhy now suppose I had brought you together, what possible harm couldhave happened from it? It would merely have given each of you somenotion of a fever and ague; for first you would both have been hot, andthen you would both have been cold, and then you would both have turnedred, and then you would both have turned white, and then you would bothhave pretended to simper at the trick; and then there would have been anend of it.ÓÒThis is a very easy way of settling it all,Ó cried Cecilia laughing;Òhowever, you must be content to abide by your own theft, for you cannotin conscience expect I should take it upon myself.ÓÒYou are terribly ungrateful, I see,Ó said her ladyship, Òfor all thetrouble and contrivance and expence I have been at merely to oblige you,while the whole time, poor Mortimer, I dare say, has had his sweet Petadvertised in all the newspapers, and cried in every market-town in thekingdom. By the way, if you do send him back, I would advise you tolet your man demand the reward that has been offered for him, which mayserve in part of payment for his travelling expenses.ÓCecilia could only shake her head, and recollect Mrs Delvile'sexpression, that her levity was incorrigible.ÒO if you had seen,Ó she continued, Òhow sheepish Mortimer looked whenI told him you were dying to see him before he set off! he colouredso!--just as you do now!--but I think you're vastly alike.ÓÒI fear, then,Ó cried Cecilia, not very angry at this speech, Òthere isbut little chance your ladyship should like either of us.ÓÒO yes, I do! I like odd people of all things.ÓÒOdd people? and in what are we so very odd?ÓÒO, in a thousand things. You're so good, you know, and so grave, and sosqueamish.ÓÒSqueamish? how?ÓÒWhy, you know, you never laugh at the old folks, and never fly at yourservants, nor smoke people before their faces, and are so civil to theold fograms, you would make one imagine you liked nobody so well. Bythe way, I could do no good with my little Lord Derford; he pretendedto find out I was only laughing at him, and so he minded nothing I toldhim. I dare say, however, his father made the detection, for I am surehe had not wit enough to discover it himself.ÓCecilia then, very seriously began to entreat that she would return thedog herself, and confess her frolic, remonstrating in strong terms uponthe mischievous tendency and consequences of such inconsiderate flights.ÒWell,Ó cried she, rising, Òthis is all vastly true; but I have no timeto hear any more of it just now; besides, it's only forestalling my nextlecture from Mrs Delvile, for you talk so much alike, that it is reallyvery perplexing to me to remember which is which.ÓShe then hurried away, protesting she had already outstayed her father'spatience, and declaring the delay of another minute would occasionhalf a dozen expresses to know whether she was gone towards Scotland orFlanders.This visit, however, was both pleasant and consolatory to Cecilia; whowas now relieved from her suspence, and revived in her spirits by theintelligence that Delvile had no share in sending her a present, which,from him, would have been humiliating and impertinent. She regretted,indeed, that she had not instantly returned it to the castle, which shewas now convinced was the measure she ought to have pursued; but to makeall possible reparation, she determined that her own servant shouldset out with him the next morning to Bristol, and take a letter toMrs Delvile to explain what had happened, since to conceal it from anydelicacy to Lady Honoria, would be to expose herself to suspicions themost mortifying, for which that gay and careless young lady would neverthank her.She gave orders, therefore, to her servant to get ready for the journey.When she communicated these little transactions to Mrs Charlton, thatkind-hearted old lady, who knew her fondness for Fidel, advised her notyet to part with him, but merely to acquaint Mrs Delvile where he was,and what Lady Honoria had done, and, by leaving to herself the careof settling his restoration, to give her, at least, an opportunity ofoffering him to her acceptance.Cecilia, however, would listen to no such proposal; she saw the firmnessof Delvile in his resolution to avoid her, and knew that policy, as wellas propriety, made it necessary she should part with what she could onlyretain to remind her of one whom she now most wished to forget.CHAPTER iii. -- AN INCIDENT.The spirits of Cecilia, however, internally failed her; she consideredher separation from Delvile to be now, in all probability, for life,since she saw that no struggle either of interest, inclination, orhealth, could bend him from his purpose; his mother, too, seemed toregard his name and his existence as equally valuable, and the scruplesof his father she was certain would be still more insurmountable. Herown pride, excited by theirs, made her, indeed, with more anger thansorrow, see this general consent to abandon her; but pride and angerboth failed when she considered the situation of his health; sorrow,there, took the lead, and admitted no partner; it represented him toher not only as lost to herself, but to the world; and so sad grew herreflections, and so heavy her heart, that, to avoid from Mrs Charltonobservations which pained her, she stole into a summer-house in thegarden the moment she had done tea, declining any companion but heraffectionate Fidel.Her tenderness and her sorrow found here a romantic consolation, incomplaining to him of the absence of his master, his voluntary exile,and her fears for his health; calling upon him to participate in hersorrow, and lamenting that even this little relief would soon be deniedher; and that in losing Fidel no vestige of Mortimer, but in her ownbreast, would remain; ÒGo, then, dear Fidel,Ó she cried, Òcarry back toyour master all that nourishes his remembrance! Bid him not love you theless for having some time belonged to Cecilia; but never may his proudheart be fed with the vain glory of knowing how fondly for his sake shehas cherished you! Go, dear Fidel, guard him by night, and follow himby day; serve him with zeal, and love him with fidelity;--oh that hishealth were invincible as his pride!--there, alone, is he vulnerable--ÓHere Fidel, with a loud barking, suddenly sprang away from her, and, asshe turned her eyes towards the door to see what had thus startled him,she beheld standing there, as if immoveable, young Delvile himself!Her astonishment at this sight almost bereft her of her understanding;it appeared to her supernatural, and she rather believed it was hisghost than himself. Fixed in mute wonder, she stood still thoughterrified, her eyes almost bursting from their sockets to be satisfiedif what they saw was real.Delvile, too, was some time speechless; he looked not at her, indeed,with any doubt of her existence, but as if what he had heard was to himas amazing as to her what she saw. At length, however, tormented by thedog, who jumpt up to him, licked his hands, and by his rapturous joyforced himself into notice, he was moved to return his caresses, saying,ÒYes, dear Fidel! you have a claim indeed to my attention, and with thefondest gratitude will I cherish you ever!ÓAt the sound of his voice, Cecilia again began to breathe; and Delvilehaving quieted the dog, now entered the summer-house, saying, as headvanced, ÒIs this possible!--am I not in a dream?--Good God! is itindeed possible!ÓThe consternation of doubt and astonishment which had seized everyfaculty of Cecilia, now changed into certainty that Delvile indeedwas present, all her recollection returned as she listened, to thisquestion, and the wild rambling of fancy with which she had incautiouslyindulged her sorrow, rushing suddenly upon her mind, she felt herselfwholly overpowered by consciousness and shame, and sunk, almostfainting, upon a window-seat.Delvile instantly flew to her, penetrated with gratitude, and filledwith wonder and delight, which, however internally combated bysensations less pleasant, were too potent for controul, and he pouredforth at her feet the most passionate acknowledgments.Cecilia, surprised, affected, and trembling with a thousand emotions,endeavoured to break from him and rise; but, eagerly detaining her, ÒNo,loveliest Miss Beverley,Ó he cried, Ònot thus must we now part! thismoment only have I discovered what a treasure I was leaving; and, butfor Fidel, I had quitted it in ignorance for ever.ÓÒIndeed,Ó cried Cecilia, in the extremest agitation, Òindeed you maybelieve me Fidel is here quite by accident.--Lady Honoria took himaway,--I knew nothing of the matter,--she stole him, she sent him, shedid every thing herself.ÓÒO kind Lady Honoria!Ó cried Delvile, more and more delighted, Òhowshall I ever thank her!--And did she also tell you to caress and tocherish him?--to talk to him of his master--ÓÒO heaven!Ó interrupted Cecilia, in an agony of mortification and shame,Òto what has my unguarded folly reduced me!Ó Then again endeavouring tobreak from him, ÒLeave me, Mr Delvile,Ó she cried, Òleave me, or let mepass!--never can I see you more!--never bear you again in my sight!ÓÒCome, dear Fidel!Ó cried he, still detaining her, Òcome and plead foryour master! come and ask in his name who now has a proud heart, whosepride now is invincible!ÓÒOh go!Ó cried Cecilia, looking away from him while she spoke, Òrepeatnot those hateful words, if you wish me not to detest myself eternally!ÓÒEver-lovely Miss Beverley,Ó cried he, more seriously, Òwhy thisresentment? why all this causeless distress? Has not my heart longsince been known to you? have you not witnessed its sufferings, andbeen assured of its tenderness? why, then, this untimely reserve?this unabating coldness? Oh why try to rob me of the felicity you haveinadvertently given me! and to sour the happiness of a moment thatrecompenses such exquisite misery!ÓÒOh Mr Delvile!Ó cried she, impatiently, though half softened, Òwas thishonourable or right? to steal upon me thus privately--to listen to methus secretly--ÓÒYou blame me,Ó cried he, Òtoo soon; your own friend, Mrs Charlton,permitted me to come hither in search of you;--then, indeed, when Iheard the sound of your voice--when I heard that voice talk of Fidel--ofhis master--ÓÒOh stop, stop!Ó cried she; ÒI cannot support the recollection! there isno punishment, indeed, which my own indiscretion does not merit,--but Ishall have sufficient in the bitterness of self-reproach!ÓÒWhy will you talk thus, my beloved Miss Beverley? what have youdone,--what, let me ask, have I done, that such infinite disgraceand depression should follow this little sensibility to a passion sofervent? Does it not render you more dear to me than ever? does it notadd new life, new vigour, to the devotion by which I am bound to you?ÓÒNo, no,Ó cried the mortified Cecilia, who from the moment she foundherself betrayed, believed herself to be lost, Òfar other is the effectit will have! and the same mad folly by which I am ruined in my ownesteem, will ruin me in yours!--I cannot endure to think of it!--whywill you persist in detaining me?--You have filled me with anguish andmortification,--you have taught me the bitterest of lessons, that ofhating and contemning myself!ÓÒGood heaven,Ó cried he, much hurt, Òwhat strange apprehensions thusterrify you? are you with me less safe than with yourself? is it myhonour you doubt? is it my integrity you fear? Surely I cannot be solittle known to you; and to make protestations now, would but give a newalarm to a delicacy already too agitated.--Else would I tell you thatmore sacred than my life will I hold what I have heard, that the wordsjust now graven on my heart, shall remain there to eternity unseen;and that higher than ever, not only in my love, but my esteem, is thebeautiful speaker.Ó--ÒAh no!Ó cried Cecilia, with a sigh, Òthat, at least, is impossible, forlower than ever is she sunk from deserving it!ÓÒNo,Ó cried he, with fervour, Òshe is raised, she is exalted! I find hermore excellent and perfect than I had even dared believe her; I discovernew virtues in the spring of every action; I see what I took forindifference, was dignity; I perceive what I imagined the most rigidinsensibility, was nobleness, was propriety, was true greatness ofmind!ÓCecilia was somewhat appeased by this speech; and, after a littlehesitation, she said, with a half smile, ÒMust I thank you for thisgood-nature in seeking to reconcile me with myself?--or shall I quarrelwith you for flattery, in giving me praise you can so little think Imerit?ÓÒAh!Ó cried he, Òwere I to praise as I think of you! were my languagepermitted to accord with my opinion of your worth, you would not thensimply call me a flatterer, you would tell me I was an idolater, andfear at least for my principles, if not for my understanding.ÓÒI shall have but little right, however,Ó said Cecilia, again rising,Òto arraign your understanding while I act as if bereft of my own.Now, at least, let me pass; indeed you will greatly displease me by anyfurther opposition.ÓÒWill you suffer me, then, to see you early to-morrow morning?ÓÒNo, Sir; nor the next morning, nor the morning after that! This meetinghas been wrong, another would be worse; in this I have accusation enoughfor folly,--in another the charge would be far more heavy.ÓÒDoes Miss Beverley, then,Ó cried he gravely, Òthink me capable ofdesiring to see her for mere selfish gratification? of intending totrifle either with her time or her feelings? no; the conference I desirewill be important and decisive. This night I shall devote solely todeliberation; to-morrow shall be given to action. Without some thinkingI dare venture at no plan;--I presume not to communicate to you thevarious interests that divide me, but the result of them all I can takeno denial to your hearing.ÓCecilia, who felt when thus stated the justice of his request, nowopposed it no longer, but insisted upon his instantly departing.ÒTrue,Ó cried he, ÒI must go!--the longer I stay, the more I amfascinated, and the weaker are those reasoning powers of which I nowwant the strongest exertion.Ó He then repeated his professions ofeternal regard, besought her not to regret the happiness she hadgiven him, and after disobeying her injunctions of going till shewas seriously displeased, he only stayed to obtain her pardon, andpermission to be early the next morning, and then, though still slowlyand reluctantly, he left her.Scarce was Cecilia again alone, but the whole of what had passed seemeda vision of her imagination. That Delvile should be at Bury, thathe should visit her at Mrs Charlton's, surprise her by herself,and discover her most secret thoughts, appeared so strange and soincredible, that, occupied rather by wonder than, thinking, shecontinued almost motionless in the place where he had left her, till MrsCharlton sent to request that she would return to the house. She thenenquired if any body was with her, and being answered in the negative,obeyed the summons.Mrs Charlton, with a smile of much meaning, hoped she had had a pleasantwalk; but Cecilia seriously remonstrated on the dangerous imprudenceshe had committed in suffering her to be so unguardedly surprised. MrsCharlton, however, more anxious for her future and solid happiness, thanfor her present apprehensions and delicacy, repented not the step shehad taken; and when she gathered from Cecilia the substance of what hadpast, unmindful of the expostulations which accompanied it, she thoughtwith exultation that the sudden meeting she had permitted, would now, bymaking known to each their mutual affection, determine them to defer nolonger a union upon which their mutual peace of mind so much depended.And Cecilia, finding she had been thus betrayed designedly, notinadvertently, could hardly reproach her zeal, though she lamented itsindiscretion.She then asked by what means he had obtained admission, and made himselfknown; and heard that he had enquired at the door for Miss Beverley,and, having sent in his name, was shewn into the parlour, where MrsCharlton, much pleased with his appearance, had suddenly conceivedthe little plan which she had executed, of contriving a surprise forCecilia, from which she rationally expected the very consequences thatensued, though the immediate means she had not conjectured.The account was still unsatisfactory to Cecilia, who could frame toherself no possible reason for a visit so extraordinary, and so totallyinconsistent with his declarations and resolutions.This, however, was a matter of but little moment, compared with theother subjects to which the interview had given rise; Delvile, upon whomso long, though secretly, her dearest hopes of happiness had rested, wasnow become acquainted with his power, and knew himself the master of herdestiny; he had quitted her avowedly to decide what it should be, sincehis present subject of deliberation included her fate in his own; thenext morning he was to call, and acquaint her with his decree, notdoubting her concurrence which ever way be resolved.A subjection so undue, and which she could not but consider asdisgraceful, both shocked and afflicted her; and the reflection that theman who of all men she preferred, was acquainted with her preference,yet hesitated whether to accept or abandon her, mortified and provokedher, alternately, occupied her thoughts the whole night, and kept herfrom peace and from rest.CHAPTER iv. -- A PROPOSITION.Early the next morning, Delvile again made his appearance. Cecilia, whowas at breakfast with Mrs and Miss Charltons, received him with the mostpainful confusion, and he was evidently himself in a state of theutmost perturbation. Mrs Charlton made a pretence almost immediatelyfor sending away both her grand-daughters, and then, without taking thetrouble of devising one for herself, arose and followed them, thoughCecilia made sundry signs of solicitation that she would stay.Finding herself now alone with him, she hastily, and without knowingwhat she said, cried, ÒHow is Mrs Delvile, Sir? Is she still atBristol?ÓÒAt Bristol? no; have you never heard she is returned to DelvileCastle?ÓÒO, true!--I meant Delvile Castle,--but I hope she found some benefitfrom the waters?ÓÒShe had not, I believe, any occasion to try them.ÓCecilia, ashamed of these two following mistakes, coloured high; butventured not again to speak; and Delvile, who seemed big with somethinghe feared to utter, arose, and walked for a few instants about the room;after which, exclaiming aloud ÒHow vain is every plan which passes thepresent hour!Ó He advanced to Cecilia, who pretended to be looking atsome work, and seating himself next her, Òwhen we parted yesterday,Ó he cried, ÒI presumed to say one night alone should be given todeliberation,--and to-day, this very day to action!--but I forgot thatthough in deliberating I had only myself to consult, in acting I was notso independent; and that when my own doubts were satisfied, and myown resolutions taken, other doubts and other resolutions must beconsidered, by which my purposed proceedings might be retarded, mightperhaps be wholly prevented!ÓHe paused, but Cecilia, unable to conjecture to what he was leading,made not any answer.ÒUpon you, madam,Ó he continued, Òall that is good or evil of my futurelife, as far as relates to its happiness or misery, will, from this veryhour, almost solely depend; yet much as I rely upon your goodness, andsuperior as I know you to trifling or affectation, what I now come topropose--to petition--to entreat--I cannot summon courage to mention,from a dread of alarming you!ÓWhat next, thought Cecilia, trembling at this introduction, is preparingfor me! does he mean to ask me to solicit Mrs Delvile's consent! or frommyself must he receive commands that we should never meet more!ÒIs Miss Beverley,Ó cried he, Òdetermined not to, speak to me? Is shebent upon silence only to intimidate me? Indeed if she knew how greatlyI respect her, she would honour me with more confidence.ÓÒWhen, Sir,Ó cried she, Òdo you mean to make your tour?ÓÒNever!Ó cried he, with fervour, Òunless banished by you, never!--no,loveliest Miss Beverley, I can now quit you no more! Fortune, beauty,worth and sweetness I had power to relinquish, and severe as was thetask, I compelled myself to perform it,--but when to these I find joinedso attractive a softness,--a pity for my sufferings so unexpectedlygentle no! sweetest Miss Beverley, I can quit you no more!Ó And then,seizing her hand, with yet greater energy, he went on, ÒI here,Ó hecried, Òoffer you my vows, I here own you sole arbitress of my fate! Igive you not merely the possession of my heart,--that, indeed, I had nopower to withhold from you,--but I give you the direction of my conduct,I entreat you to become my counsellor and guide. Will Miss Beverleyaccept such an office? Will she deign to listen to such a prayer?ÓÒYes,Ó cried Cecilia, involuntarily delighted to find that such wasthe result of his night's deliberation, ÒI am most ready to give you mycounsel; which I now do,--that you set off for the Continent to-morrowmorning.ÓÒO how malicious!Ó cried he, half laughing, Òyet not so immediately doI even request your counsel; something must first be done to qualify youfor giving it; penetration, skill and understanding, however amply youpossess them, are not sufficient to fit you for the charge; somethingstill more is requisite, you must be invested with fuller powers,you must have a right less disputable, and a title, that not alone,inclination, not even judgment alone must sanctify, but which law mustenforce, and rites the most solemn support!ÓÒI think, then,Ó said Cecilia, deeply blushing, ÒI must be content toforbear giving any counsel at all, if the qualifications for it are sodifficult of acquirement.ÓÒResent not my presumption,Ó cried he, Òmy beloved Miss Beverley, butlet the severity of my recent sufferings palliate my present temerity;for where affliction has been deep and serious, causeless andunnecessary misery will find little encouragement; and mine hasbeen serious indeed! Sweetly, then, permit me, in proportion to itsbitterness, to rejoice in the soft reverse which now flatters me withits approach.ÓCecilia, abashed and uneasy, uncertain of what was to follow, andunwilling to speak till more assured, paused, and then abruptlyexclaimed ÒI am afraid Mrs Charlton is waiting for me,Ó and would havehurried away; but Delvile, almost forcibly preventing her, compelledher to stay; and, after a short conversation, on his side the mostimpassioned, and on hers the most confused, obtained from her, what,indeed, after the surprise of the preceding evening she could butill deny, a frank confirmation of his power over her heart, and aningenuous, though reluctant acknowledgment, how long he had possessedit.This confession, made, as affairs now stood, wholly in opposition to herjudgment, was torn from her by an impetuous urgency which she had notpresence of mind to resist, and with which Delvile, when particularlyanimated, had long been accustomed to overpower all opposition. Thejoy with which he heard it, though but little mixed with wonder, was asviolent as the eagerness with which he had sought it; yet it was not oflong duration, a sudden, and most painful recollection presently quelledit, and even in the midst of his rapturous acknowledgment, seemed tostrike him to the heart.Cecilia, soon perceiving both in his countenance and manner analteration that shocked her, bitterly repented an avowal she could neverrecall, and looked aghast with expectation and dread.Delvile, who with quickness saw a change of expression in her of whichin himself he was unconscious, exclaimed, with much emotion, ÒO howtransient is human felicity! How rapidly fly those rare and exquisitemoments in which it is perfect! Ah! sweetest Miss Beverley, what wordsshall I find to soften what I have now to reveal! to tell you that,after goodness, candour, generosity such as yours, a request, asupplication remains yet to be uttered that banishes me, if refused,from your presence for ever!ÓCecilia, extremely dismayed, desired to know what it was; an evidentdread of offending her kept him some time from proceeding, but atlength, after repeatedly expressing his fears of her disapprobation, anda repugnance even on his own part to the very measure he was obliged tourge, he acknowledged that all his hopes of being ever united to her,rested upon obtaining her consent to an immediate and secret marriage.Cecilia, thunderstruck by this declaration, remained for a few instantstoo much confounded to speak; but when he was beginning an explanatoryapology, she started up, and glowing with indignation, said, ÒIhad flattered myself, Sir, that both my character and my conduct,independent of my situation in life, would have exempted me at alltimes from a proposal which I shall ever think myself degraded by havingheard.ÓAnd then she was again going, but Delvile still preventing her, said ÒIknew too well how much you would be alarmed, and such was my dread ofyour displeasure that it had power even to embitter the happinessI sought with so much earnestness, and to render your condescensioninsufficient to ensure it. Yet wonder not at my scheme; wild as it mayappear, it is the result of deliberation, and censurable as it may seem,it springs not from unworthy motives.ÓÒWhatever may be your motives with respect to yourself, Sir,Ó saidCecilia, Òwith respect to me they must certainly be disgraceful; I willnot, therefore, listen to them.ÓÒYou wrong me cruelly,Ó cried he, with warmth, Òand a moment'sreflection must tell you that however distinct may be our honour or ourdisgrace in every other instance, in that by which we should be united,they must inevitably be the same; and far sooner would I voluntarilyrelinquish you, than be myself accessory to tainting that delicacy ofwhich the unsullied purity has been the chief source of my admiration.ÓÒWhy, then,Ó cried Cecilia, reproachfully, Òhave you mentioned to mesuch a project?ÓÒCircumstances the most singular, and necessity the most unavoidable,Ó he answered, Òshould alone have ever tempted me to form it. No longerago than yesterday morning, I believed myself incapable of even wishingit; but extraordinary situations call for extraordinary resolutions,and in private as well as public life, palliate, at least, extraordinaryactions. Alas! the proposal which so much offends you is my finalresource! it is the sole barrier between myself and perpetualmisery!--the only expedient in my power to save me from eternallyparting from you!--for I am compelled now cruelly to confess, that myfamily, I am certain, will never consent to our union!ÓÒNeither, then, Sir,Ó cried Cecilia, with great spirit, Òwill I!The disdain I may meet with I pretend not to retort, but wilfully toencounter, were meanly to deserve it. I will enter into no family inopposition to its wishes, I will consent to no alliance that may exposeme to indignity. Nothing is so contagious as contempt!--The example ofyour friends might work powerfully upon yourself, and who shall dareassure me you would not catch the infection?ÓÒI dare assure you!Ó cried he; Òhasty you may perhaps think me, andsomewhat impetuous I cannot deny myself; but believe me not of sowretched a character as to be capable, in any affair of moment, offickleness or caprice.ÓÒBut what, Sir, is my security to the contrary? Have you not this momentavowed that but yesterday you held in abhorrence the very plan thatto-day you propose? And may you not to-morrow resume again the sameopinion?ÓÒCruel Miss Beverley! how unjust is this inference! If yesterday Idisapproved what to-day I recommend, a little recollection must surelytell you why; and that not my opinion, but my situation is changed.ÓThe conscious Cecilia here turned away her head; too certain he alludedto the discovery of her partiality.ÒHave you not yourself,Ó he continued, Òwitnessed the steadiness of mymind? Have you not beheld me fly, when I had power to pursue, and avoid,when I had opportunity to seek you? After witnessing my constancy uponsuch trying occasions, is it equitable, is it right to suspect me ofwavering?ÓÒBut what,Ó cried she, Òwas the constancy which brought you intoSuffolk?--When all occasion was over for our meeting any more, when youtold me you were going abroad, and took leave of me for ever,--where,then, was your steadiness in this unnecessary journey?ÓÒHave a care,Ó cried he, half smiling, and taking a letter from hispocket, Òhave a care, upon this point, how you provoke me to spew myjustification!ÓÒAh!Ó cried Cecilia, blushing, Ò'tis some trick of Lady Honoria!ÓÒNo, upon my honour. The authority is less doubtful; I believe I shouldhardly else have regarded it.ÓCecilia, much alarmed, held out her hand for the letter; and lookingfirst at the end was much astonished to see the name of Biddulph. Shethen cast her eye over the beginning, and when she saw her own name,read the following paragraph.ÒMiss Beverley, as you doubtless know, is returned into Suffolk; everybody here saw her with the utmost surprize; from the moment I had heardof her residence in Delvile Castle, I had given her up for lost; but,upon her unexpected appearance among us again, I was weak enough oncemore to make trial of her heart. I soon found, however, that the painof a second rejection you might have spared me, and that though she hadquitted Delvile Castle, she had not for nothing entered it; at the soundof your name, she blushes; at the mention of your illness, she turnspale; and the dog you have given her, which I recollected immediately,is her darling companion. Oh happy Delvile! yet so lovely a conquest youabandon.--ÓCecilia could read no more; the letter dropt from her hand; to findherself thus by her own emotions betrayed, made her instantly concludeshe was universally discovered; and turning sick at the supposition, allher spirit forsook her, and she burst into tears.ÒGood heaven,Ó cried Delvile, extremely shocked, Òwhat has thus affectedyou? Can the jealous surmises of an apprehensive rival--ÓÒDo not talk to me,Ó interrupted she, impatiently, Òand do not detainme,--I am extremely disturbed,--I wish to be alone,--I beg, I evenentreat you would leave me.ÓÒI will go, I will obey you in every thing!Ó cried he, eagerly, Òtell mebut when I may return, and when you will suffer me to explain to you allthe motives of my proposal?ÓÒNever, never!Ó cried she, with earnestness, ÒI am sufficiently loweredalready, but never will I intrude myself into a family that disdainsme!ÓÒDisdains? No, you are revered in it! who could disdain you! That fatalclause alone--ÓÒWell, well, pray leave me; indeed I cannot hear you; I am unfit forargument, and all reasoning now is nothing less than cruelty.ÓÒI am gone,Ó cried he, Òthis moment! I would not even wish to takeadvantage of your agitation in order to work upon your sensibility. Mydesire is not to surprize, but to reconcile you to my plan. What is itI seek in Miss Beverley? An Heiress? No, as such she has seen I couldresist her; nor yet the light trifler of a spring or two, neglected whenno longer a novelty; no, no!--it is a companion for ever, it is a solacefor every care, it is a bosom friend through every period of life thatI seek in Miss Beverley! Her esteem, therefore, to me is as preciousas her affection, for how can I hope her friendship in the winter ofmy days, if their brighter and gayer season is darkened by doubts ofmy integrity? All shall be clear and explicit; no latent cause ofuneasiness shall disturb our future quiet; we will now be sincere, thathereafter we may be easy; and sweetly in unclouded felicity, time shallglide away imperceptibly, and we will make an interest with eachother in the gaiety of youth, to bear with the infirmities of age, andalleviate them by kindness and sympathy. And then shall my soothingCecilia--ÓÒO say no more!Ó interrupted she, softened in her own despite by a planso consonant to her wishes, Òwhat language is this! how improper for youto use, or me to hear!ÓShe then very earnestly insisted upon his going; and after a thousandtimes taking leave and returning, promising obedience, yet pursuing hisown way, he at length said if she would consent to receive a letter fromhim, he would endeavour to commit what he had to communicate to paper,since their mutual agitation made him unable to explain himself withclearness, and rather hurt his cause than assisted it, by leaving allhis arguments unfinished and obscure.Another dispute now arose; Cecilia protesting she would receive noletter, and hear nothing upon the subject; and Delvile impetuouslydeclaring he would submit to no award without being first heard. Atlength he conquered, and at length he departed.Cecilia then felt her whole heart sink within her at the unhappiness ofher situation. She considered herself now condemned to refuse Delvileherself, as the only condition upon which he even solicited her favour,neither the strictness of her principles, nor the delicacy of her mind,would suffer her to accept. Her displeasure at the proposal had beenwholly unaffected, and she regarded it as an injury to her characterever to have received it; yet that Delvile's pride of heart should giveway to his passion, that he should love her with so much fondness as torelinquish for her the ambitious schemes of his family, and even thatdarling name which so lately seemed annexed to his existence, werecircumstances to which she was not insensible, and proofs of tendernessand regard which she had thought incompatible with the general spiritof his disposition. Yet however by these she was gratified, she resolvednever to comply with so humiliating a measure, but to wait the consentof his friends, or renounce him for ever.CHAPTER v. -- A LETTER.As soon as Mrs Charlton was acquainted with the departure of youngDelvile, she returned to Cecilia, impatient to be informed what hadpassed. The narration she heard both hurt and astonished her; thatCecilia, the Heiress of such a fortune, the possessor of so much beauty,descended of a worthy family, and formed and educated to grace a nobleone, should be rejected by people to whom her wealth would be mostuseful, and only in secret have their alliance proposed to her, shedeemed an indignity that called for nothing but resentment, andapproved and enforced the resolution of her young friend to resist allsolicitations which Mr and Mrs Delvile did not second themselves.About, two hours after Delvile was gone, his letter arrived. Ceciliaopened it with trepidation, and read as follows.To Miss Beverley.September 20, 1779.What could be the apprehensions, the suspicions of Miss Beverley when soearnestly she prohibited my writing? From a temper so unguarded as minecould she fear any subtlety of doctrine? Is my character so little knownto her that she can think me capable of craft or duplicity? Had I eventhe desire, I have neither the address nor the patience to practicethem; no, loveliest Miss Beverley, though sometimes by vehemence I mayincautiously offend, by sophistry, believe me, I never shall injure;my ambition, as I have told you, is to convince, not beguile, and myarguments shall be simple as my professions shall be sincere.Yet how again may I venture to mention a proposal which so lately almostbefore you had heard you rejected? Suffer me, however, to assure youit resulted neither from insensibility to your delicacy, nor to my ownduty; I made it, on the contrary, with that reluctance and timiditywhich were given me by an apprehension that both seemed to be offendedby it;--but alas! already I have said what with grief I must repeat, Ihave no resource, no alternative, between receiving the honour of yourhand in secret or foregoing you for ever.You will wonder, you may well wonder at such a declaration; and againthat severe renunciation with which you wounded me, will tremble onyour lips,--Oh there let it stop! nor let the air again be agitated withsounds so discordant!In that cruel and heart-breaking moment when I tore myself from youat Delvile Castle, I confessed to you the reason of my flight, and Idetermined to see you no more. I named not to you, then, my family,the potency of my own objections against daring to solicit your favourrendering theirs immaterial; my own are now wholly removed, but theirsremain in full force.My father, descended of a race which though decaying in wealth, isunsubdued in pride, considers himself as the guardian of the honourof his house, to which he holds the name of his ancestors inseparablyannexed; my mother, born of the same family, and bred to the same ideas,has strengthened this opinion by giving it the sanction of her own.Such being their sentiments; you will not, madam, be surprised thattheir only son, the sole inheritor of their fortune, and sole object oftheir expectations, should early have admitted the same. Indeed almostthe first lesson I was taught was that of reverencing the familyfrom which I am descended, and the name to which I am born. I was bidconsider myself as its only remaining support, and sedulously instructedneither to act nor think but with a view to its aggrandizement anddignity.Thus, unchecked by ourselves, and uncontrouled by the world, thishaughty self-importance acquired by time a strength, and by mutualencouragement a firmness, which Miss Beverley alone could possibly, Ibelieve, have shaken! What, therefore, was my secret alarm, when first Iwas conscious of the force of her attractions, and found my mind whollyoccupied with admiration of her excellencies! All that pride coulddemand, and all to which ambition could aspire, all that happiness couldcovet, or the most scrupulous delicacy exact, in her I found united; andwhile my heart was enslaved by her charms, my understanding exulted inits fetters. Yet to forfeit my name, to give up for-ever a family whichupon me rested its latest expectations,--Honour, I thought forbad it,propriety and manly spirit revolted at the sacrifice. The renunciationof my birth-right seemed a desertion of the post in which I wasstationed; I forbore, therefore, even in my wishes, to solicit yourfavour, and vigorously determined to fly you as dangerous to my peace,because unattainable without dishonour.Such was the intended regulation of my conduct at the time I receivedBiddulph's letter; in three days I was to leave England; my father,with much persuasion, had consented to my departure; my mother, whopenetrated into my motives, had never opposed it; but how great wasthe change wrought upon my mind by reading that letter! my steadinessforsook me, my resolution wavered; yet I thought him deceived, andattributed his suspicions to jealousy; but still, Fidel I knew wasmissing--and to hear he was your darling companion--was it possible toquit England in a state of such uncertainty? to be harassed in distantclimates with conjectures I might then never satisfy? No; I told myfriends I must visit Biddulph before I left the kingdom, and promisingto return to them in three or four days, I hastily set out for Suffolk,and rested not till I arrived at Mrs Charlton's.What a scene there awaited me! to behold the loved mistress of my heart,the opposed, yet resistless object of my fondest admiration, caressingan animal she knew to be mine, mourning over him his master's illhealth, and sweetly recommending to him fidelity,--Ah! forgive theretrospection, I will dwell on it no longer. Little, indeed, had Iimagined with what softness the dignity of Miss Beverley was blended,though always conscious that her virtues, her attractions, and herexcellencies, would reflect lustre upon the highest station to whichhuman grandeur could raise her, and would still be more exalted than herrank, though that were the most eminent upon earth.--And had there beena thousand, and ten thousand obstacles to oppose my addressing her,vigorously and undauntedly would I have combated with them all, inpreference to yielding to this single objection!Let not the frankness of this declaration irritate you, but rather letit serve to convince you of the sincerity of what follows; various asare the calamities of life which may render me miserable, YOU only,among even its chosen felicities, have power to make me happy. Fame,honours, wealth, ambition, were insufficient without you; all chance ofinternal peace, and every softer hope is now centered in yourfavour, and to lose you, from whatever cause, ensures me wretchednessunmitigated. With respect therefore to myself, the die is finally cast,and the conflict between bosom felicity and family pride is deliberatelyover. This name which so vainly I have cherished and so painfullysupported, I now find inadequate to recompense me for the sacrificewhich its preservation requires. I part with it, I own, with regret thatthe surrender is necessary; yet is it rather an imaginary than an actualevil, and though a deep wound to pride, no offence to morality.Thus have I laid open to you my whole heart, confessed my perplexities,acknowledged my vain-glory, and exposed with equal sincerity the sourcesof my doubts, and the motives of my decision; but now, indeed, how toproceed I know not; the difficulties which are yet to encounter I fearto enumerate, and the petition I have to urge I have scarce courage tomention.My family, mistaking ambition for honour, and rank for dignity, havelong planned a splendid connection for me, to which though my invariablerepugnance has stopt any advances, their wishes and their viewsimmovably adhere. I am but too certain they will now listen to no other.I dread, therefore, to make a trial where I despair of success, I knownot how to risk a prayer with those who may silence me by a command.In a situation so desperate, what then remains? Must I make anapplication with a certainty of rejection, and then mock all authorityby acting in defiance of it? Or, harder task yet! relinquish my dearesthopes when no longer persuaded of their impropriety? Ah! sweetest MissBeverley, end the struggle at once! My happiness, my peace, are whollyin your power, for the moment of our union secures them for life.It may seem to you strange that I should thus purpose to brave thefriends whom I venture not to entreat; but from my knowledge of theircharacters and sentiments I am certain I have no other resource. Theirfavourite principles were too early imbibed to be now at this lateseason eradicated. Slaves that we all are to habits, and dupes toappearances, jealous guardians of our pride, to which our comfort issacrificed, and even our virtue made subservient, what conviction canbe offered by reason, to notions that exist but by prejudice? They havebeen cherished too long for rhetorick to remove them, they can onlybe expelled by all-powerful Necessity. Life is, indeed, too brief,and success too precarious, to trust, in any case where happiness isconcerned, the extirpation of deep-rooted and darling opinions, to theslow-working influence of argument and disquisition.Yet bigotted as they are to rank and family, they adore Miss Beverley,and though their consent to the forfeiture of their name might foreverbe denied, when once they beheld her the head and ornament of theirhouse, her elegance and accomplishments joined to the splendour of herfortune, would speedily make them forget the plans which now whollyabsorb them. Their sense of honour is in nothing inferior to their senseof high birth; your condescension, therefore, would be felt by them inits fullest force, and though, during their first surprize, they mightbe irritated against their son, they would make it the study of theirlives that the lady who for him had done so much, should never, throughtheir means, repine for herself.With regard to settlements, the privacy of our union would not affectthem; one Confident we must unavoidably trust, and I would deposit inthe hands of whatever person you would name, a bond by which I wouldengage myself to settle both your fortune and my own, according to thearbitration of our mutual friends. The time for secrecy though painfulwould be short, and even from the altar, if you desired it, I wouldhasten to Delvile Castle. Not one of my friends should you see till theywaited upon you themselves to solicit your presence at their house, tillour residence elsewhere was fixed.Oh loveliest Cecilia, from a dream Of happiness so sweet awaken me not!from a plan Of felicity so attractive turn not away! If one part of itis unpleasant, reject not therefore all; and since without some drawbackno earthly bliss is attainable, do not, by a refinement too scrupulousfor the short period of our existence, deny yourself that delightwhich your benevolence will afford you, in snatching from the pangs ofunavailing regret and misery, the gratefullest of men in the humblestand most devoted of your servants, MORTIMER DELVILE.Cecilia read and re-read this letter, but with a perturbation of mindthat made her little able to weigh its contents. Paragraph byparagraph her sentiments varied, and her determination was changed; theearnestness of his supplication now softened her into compliance, theacknowledged pride of his family now irritated her into resentment, andthe confession of his own regret now sickened her into despondence. Shemeant in an immediate answer, to have written a final dismission;but though proof against his entreaties, because not convinced by hisarguments, there was something in the conclusion of his letter thatstaggered her resolution.Those scruples and that refinement against which he warned her, sheherself thought might be overstrained, and to gratify unnecessarypunctilio, the short period of existence be rendered causelesslyunhappy. He had truly said that their union would be no offence tomorality, and with respect merely to pride, why should that be spared?He knew he possessed her heart, she had long been certain of his,her character had early gained the affection of his mother, and theessential service which an income such as hers must do the family, wouldsoon be felt too powerfully to make her connection with it regretted.These reflections were so pleasant she knew not how to discard them; andthe consciousness that her secret was betrayed not only to himself, butto Mr Biddulph, Lord Ernolf, Lady Honoria Pemberton, and Mrs Delvile,gave them additional force, by making it probable she was yet morewidely suspected. But still her delicacy and her principles revoltedagainst a conduct of which the secrecy seemed to imply the impropriety.ÒHow shall I meet Mrs Delvile,Ó cried she, Òafter an action soclandestine? How, after praise such as she has bestowed upon me, bearthe severity of her eye, when she thinks I have seduced from her theobedience of her son! A son who is the sole solace and first hope of herexistence, whose virtues make all her happiness, and whose filial pietyis her only glory!--And well may she glory in a son such as Delvile!Nobly has he exerted himself in situations the most difficult, hisfamily and his ideas of honour he has preferred to his peace and health,he has fulfilled with spirit and integrity the various, the conflictingduties of life. Even now, perhaps, in his present application, hemay merely think himself bound by knowing me no longer free, and hisgenerous sensibility to the weakness he has discovered, without any ofthe conviction to which he pretends, may have occasioned this proposal!ÓA suggestion so mortifying again changed her determination; and thetears of Henrietta Belfield, with the letter which she had surprized inher hand recurring to her memory, all her thoughts turned once more uponrejecting him for-ever.In this fluctuating state of mind she found writing impracticable;while uncertain what to wish, to decide was impossible. She disdainedcoquetry, she was superior to trifling, the candour and openness ofDelvile had merited all her sincerity, and therefore while any doubtremained, with herself, she held it unworthy her character to tell himshe had none.Mrs Charlton, upon reading the letter, became again the advocate ofDelvile; the frankness with which he had stated his difficulties assuredher of his probity, and by explaining his former conduct, satisfied herwith the rectitude of his future intentions. ÒDo not, therefore, my dearchild,Ó cried she, Òbecome the parent of your own misery by refusinghim; he deserves you alike from his principles and his affection, andthe task would both be long and melancholy to disengage him from yourheart. I see not, however, the least occasion for the disgrace of aprivate marriage; I know not any family to which you would not be anhonour, and those who feel not your merit, are little worth pleasing.Let Mr Delvile, therefore, apply openly to his friends, and if theyrefuse their consent, be their prejudices their reward. You are freedfrom all obligations where caprice only can raise objections, and youmay then, in the face of the world, vindicate your choice.ÓThe wishes of Cecilia accorded with this advice, though the generaltenour of Delvile's letter gave her little reason to expect he wouldfollow it.CHAPTER vi. -- A DISCUSSION.The day past away, and Cecilia had yet written no answer; the eveningcame, and her resolution was still unfixed. Delvile, at length,was again announced; and though she dreaded trusting herself to hisentreaties, the necessity of hastening some decision deterred her fromrefusing to see him.Mrs Charlton was with her when he entered the room; he attempted atfirst some general conversation, though the anxiety of his mind wasstrongly pictured upon his face. Cecilia endeavoured also to talk uponcommon topics, though her evident embarrassment spoke the absence of herthoughts.Delvile at length, unable any longer to bear suspence, turned to MrsCharlton, and said, ÒYou are probably acquainted, madam, with thepurport of the letter I had the honour of sending to Miss Beverley thismorning?ÓÒYes, Sir,Ó answered the old lady, Òand you need desire little more thanthat her opinion of it may be as favourable as mine.ÓDelvile bowed and thanked her; and looking at Cecilia, to whom heventured not to speak, he perceived in her countenance a mixture ofdejection and confusion, that told him whatever might be her opinion, ithad by no means encreased her happiness.ÒBut why, Sir,Ó said Mrs Charlton, Òshould you be thus sure of thedisapprobation of your friends? had you not better hear what they haveto say?ÓÒI know, madam, what they have to say,Ó returned he; Òfor their languageand their principles have been invariable from my birth; to apply tothem, therefore, for a concession which I am certain they will notgrant, were only a cruel device to lay all my misery to their account.ÓÒAnd if they are so perverse, they deserve from you nothing better,Ó said Mrs Charlton; Òspeak to them, however; you will then have done yourduty; and if they are obstinately unjust, you will have acquired a rightto act for yourself.ÓÒTo mock their authority,Ó answered Delvile, Òwould be more offensivethan to oppose it; to solicit their approbation, and then act indefiance of it, might justly provoke their indignation.--No; if at lastI am reduced to appeal to them, by their decision I must abide.ÓTo this Mrs Charlton could make no answer, and in a few minutes she leftthe room.ÒAnd is such, also,Ó said Delvile, Òthe opinion of Miss Beverley? hasshe doomed me to be wretched, and does she wish that doom to be signedby my nearest friends!ÓÒIf your friends, Sir,Ó said Cecilia, Òare so undoubtedly inflexible, itwere madness, upon any plan, to risk their displeasure.ÓÒTo entreaty,Ó he answered, Òthey will be inflexible, but not toforgiveness. My father, though haughty, dearly, even passionately lovesme; my mother, though high-spirited, is just, noble, and generous. Sheis, indeed, the most exalted of women, and her power over my mind Iam unaccustomed to resist. Miss Beverley alone seems born to be herdaughter--ÓÒNo, no,Ó interrupted Cecilia, Òas her daughter she rejects me!ÓÒShe loves, she adores you!Ó cried he warmly; Òand were I not certainshe feels your excellencies as they ought to be felt, my venerationfor you both should even yet spare you my present supplication. But youwould become, I am certain, the first blessing of her life; in you shewould behold all the felicity of her son,--his restoration to health, tohis country, to his friends!ÓÒO Sir,Ó cried Cecilia, with emotion, Òhow deep a trench of real miserydo you sink, in order to raise this pile of fancied happiness! But Iwill not be responsible for your offending such a mother; scarcelycan you honour her yourself more than I do; and I here declare mostsolemnly--ÓÒO stop!Ó interrupted Delvile, Òand resolve not till you have heard me.Would you, were she no more, were my father also no more, would you yetpersist in refusing me?ÓÒWhy should you ask me?Ó said Cecilia, blushing; Òyou would then be yourown agent, and perhaps--ÓShe hesitated, and Delvile vehemently exclaimed, ÒOh make me not amonster! force me not to desire the death of the very beings by whom Ilive! weaken not the bonds of affection by which they are endeared tome, and compel me not to wish them no more as the sole barriers to myhappiness!ÓÒHeaven forbid!Ó cried Cecilia, Òcould I believe you so impious, Ishould suffer little indeed in desiring your eternal absence.ÓÒWhy then only upon their extinction must I rest my hope of yourfavour?ÓCecilia, staggered and distressed by this question, could make noanswer. Delvile, perceiving her embarrassment, redoubled his urgency;and before she had power to recollect herself, she had almost consentedto his plan, when Henrietta Belfield rushing into her memory, shehastily exclaimed, ÒOne doubt there is, which I know not how to mention,but ought to have cleared up;--you are acquainted with--you rememberMiss Belfield?ÓÒCertainly; but what of Miss Belfield that can raise a doubt in the mindof Miss Beverley?ÓCecilia coloured, and was silent.ÒIs it possible,Ó continued he, Òyou could ever for an instantsuppose--but I cannot even name a supposition so foreign to allpossibility.ÓÒShe is surely very amiable?ÓÒYes,Ó answered he, Òshe is innocent, gentle, and engaging; and Iheartily wish she were in a better situation.ÓÒDid you ever occasionally, or by any accident, correspond with her?ÓÒNever in my life.ÓÒAnd were not your visits to the brother sometimes--ÓÒHave a care,Ó interrupted he, laughing, Òlest I reverse the question,and ask if your visits to the sister were not sometimes for the brother!But what does this mean? Could Miss Beverley imagine that after knowingher, the charms of Miss Belfield could put me in any danger?ÓCecilia, bound in delicacy and friendship not to betray the tender andtrusting Henrietta, and internally satisfied of his innocence by hisfrankness, evaded any answer; and would now have done with the subject;but Delvile, eager wholly to exculpate himself, though by no meansdispleased at an enquiry which shewed so much interest in hisaffections, continued his explanation.ÒMiss Belfield has, I grant, an attraction in the simplicity of hermanners which charms by its singularity; her heart, too, seems allpurity, and her temper all softness. I have not, you find, been blind toher merit; on the contrary, I have both admired and pitied her. Butfar indeed is she removed from all chance of rivalry in my heart! Acharacter such as hers for a while is irresistibly alluring; but whenits novelty is over, simplicity uninformed becomes wearisome, andsoftness without dignity is too indiscriminate to give delight. We sighfor entertainment, when cloyed by mere sweetness; and heavily drags onthe load of life when the companion of our social hours wants spirit,intelligence, and cultivation. With Miss Beverley all these--ÓÒTalk not of all these,Ó cried Cecilia, Òwhen one single obstacle haspower to render them valueless.ÓÒBut now,Ó cried he, Òthat obstacle is surmounted.ÓÒSurmounted only for a moment! for even in your letter this morning youconfess the regret with which it fills you.ÓÒAnd why should I deceive you? Why pretend to think with pleasure, oreven with indifference, of an obstacle which has had thus long the powerto make me miserable? But where is happiness without allay? Is perfectbliss the condition of humanity? Oh if we refuse to taste it till inits last state of refinement, how shall the cup of evil be ever from ourlips?ÓÒHow indeed!Ó said Cecilia, with a sigh; Òthe regret, I believe, willremain eternally upon your mind, and she, perhaps, who should cause,might soon be taught to partake of it.ÓÒO Miss Beverley! how have I merited this severity? Did I make myproposals lightly? Did I suffer my eagerness to conquer my reason? HaveI not, on the contrary, been steady and considerate? neither biassed bypassion nor betrayed by tenderness?ÓÒAnd yet in what,Ó said Cecilia, Òconsists this boasted steadiness? Iperceived it indeed, at Delvile Castle, but here--ÓÒThe pride of heart which supported me there,Ó cried he, Òwill supportme no longer; what sustained my firmness, but your apparent severity?What enabled me to fly you, but your invariable coldness? The rigourwith which I trampled upon my feelings I thought fortitude andspirit,--but I knew not then the pitying sympathy of Cecilia!ÓÒO that you knew it not yet!Ó cried she, blushing; Òbefore that fatalaccident you thought of me, I believe, in a manner far more honourable.ÓÒImpossible! differently, I thought of you, but never, better, never sowell as now. I then represented you all lovely in beauty, all perfect ingoodness and virtue; but it was virtue in its highest majesty, not, asnow, blended with the softest sensibility.ÓÒAlas!Ó said Cecilia, Òhow the portrait is faded!ÓÒNo, it is but more from the life; it is the sublimity of an angel,mingled with all that is attractive in woman. But who is the friend wemay venture to trust? To whom may I give my bond? And from whom may Ireceive a treasure which for the rest of my life will constitute all itsfelicity?ÓÒWhere can I,Ó cried Cecilia, Òfind a friend, who, in this criticalmoment will instruct me how to act!ÓÒYou will find one,Ó answered he, Òin your own bosom; ask but yourselfthis plain question; will any virtue be offended by your honouring mewith your hand?ÓÒYes; duty will be offended, since it is contrary to the will of yourparents.ÓÒBut is there no time for emancipation? Am not I of an age to chusefor myself the partner of my life? Will not you in a few days be theuncontrolled mistress of your actions? Are we not both independent? Yourample fortune all your own, and the estates of my father so entailedthey must unavoidably be mine?ÓÒAnd are these,Ó said Cecilia, Òconsiderations to set us free from ourduty?ÓÒNo, but they are circumstances to relieve us from slavery. Let me notoffend you if I am still more explicit. When no law, human or divine,can be injured by our union, when one motive of pride is all that can beopposed to a thousand motives of convenience and happiness, whyshould we both be made unhappy, merely lest that pride should lose itsgratification?ÓThis question, which so often and so angrily she had revolved in her ownmind, again silenced her; and Delvile, with the eagerness of approachingsuccess, redoubled his solicitations.ÒBe mine,Ó he cried, Òsweetest Cecilia, and all will go well. To referme to my friends is, effectually, to banish me for ever. Spare me, then,the unavailing task; and save me from the resistless entreaties of amother, whose every desire I have held sacred, whose wish has beenmy law, and whose commands I have implicitly, invariably obeyed!Oh generously save me from the dreadful alternative of wounding hermaternal heart by a peremptory refusal, or of torturing my own withpangs to which it is unequal by an extorted obedience!ÓÒAlas!Ó cried Cecilia, Òhow utterly impossible I can relieve you!ÓÒAnd why? once mine, irrevocably mine---.ÓÒNo, that would but irritate,--and irritate past hope of pardon.ÓÒIndeed you are mistaken; to your merit they are far from insensible,and your fortune is just what they wish. Trust me, therefore, when Iassure you that their displeasure, which both respect and justice willguard them from ever shewing you, will soon die wholly away. I speak notmerely from my hopes; in judging my own friends, I consider human naturein general. Inevitable evils are ever best supported. It is suspence,it is hope that make the food of misery; certainty is always endured,because known to be past amendment, and felt to give defiance tostruggling.ÓÒAnd can you,Ó cried Cecilia, Òwith reasoning so desperate be satisfied?ÒIn a situation so extraordinary as ours,Ó answered he, Òthere is noother. The voice of the world at large will be all in our favour. Ourunion neither injures our fortunes, nor taints our morality; withthe character of each the other is satisfied, and both must be alikeexculpated from mercenary views of interest, or romantic contempt ofpoverty; what right have we, then, to repine at an objection which,however potent, is single? Surely none. Oh if wholly unchecked were thehappiness I now have in view, if no foul storm sometimes lowered overthe prospect, and for the moment obscured its brightness, how couldmy heart find room for joy so superlative? The whole world might riseagainst me as the first man in it who had nothing left to wish!ÓCecilia, whose own hopes aided this reasoning, found not much to opposeto it; and with little more of entreaty, and still less of argument,Delvile at length obtained her consent to his plan. Fearfully,indeed, and with unfeigned reluctance she gave it, but it was theonly alternative with a separation for-ever, to which she held not thenecessity adequate to the pain.The thanks of Delvile were as vehement as had been his entreaties,which yet, however, were not at an end; the concession she had made wasimperfect, unless its performance were immediate, and he now endeavouredto prevail with her to be his before the expiration of a week.Here, however, his task ceased to be difficult; Cecilia, as ingenuousby nature as she was honourable from principle, having once brought hermind to consent to his proposal, sought not by studied difficulties toenhance the value of her compliance; the great point resolved upon, sheheld all else of too little importance for a contest.Mrs Charlton was now called in, and acquainted with the result of theirconference. Her approbation by no means followed the scheme of privacy;yet she was too much rejoiced in seeing her young friend near the periodof her long suspence and uneasiness, to oppose any plan which mightforward their termination.Delvile then again begged to know what male confidant might be entrustedwith their project.Mr Monckton immediately occurred to Cecilia, though the certainty of hisill-will to the cause made all application to him disagreeable; but hislong and steady friendship for her, his readiness to counsel and assisther, and the promises she had occasionally made, not to act withouthis advice, all concurred to persuade her that in a matter of suchimportance, she owed to him her confidence, and should be culpableto proceed without it. Upon him, therefore, she fixed; yet finding inherself a repugnance insuperable to acquainting him with her situation,she agreed that Delvile, who instantly proposed to be her messenger,should open to him the affair, and prepare him for their meeting.Delvile then, rapid in thought and fertile in expedients, with acelerity and vigour which bore down all objections, arranged the wholeconduct of the business. To avoid suspicion, he determined instantlyto quit her, and, as soon as he had executed his commission with MrMonckton, to hasten to London, that the necessary preparations for theirmarriage might be made with dispatch and secrecy. He purposed, also, tofind out Mr Belfield; that he might draw up the bond with which he meantto entrust Mr Monckton. This measure Cecilia would have opposed, buthe refused to listen to her. Mrs Charlton herself, though her age andinfirmities had long confined her to her own house, gratified Ceciliaupon this critical occasion with consenting to accompany her to thealtar. Mr Monckton was depended upon for giving her away, and a churchin London was the place appointed for the performance of the ceremony.In three days the principal difficulties to the union would be removedby Cecilia's coming of age, and in five days it was agreed that theyshould actually meet in town. The moment they were married Delvilepromised to set off for the castle, while in another chaise, Ceciliareturned to Mrs Charlton's. This settled, he conjured her to bepunctual, and earnestly recommending himself to her fidelity andaffection, he bid her adieu.CHAPTER vii. -- A RETROSPECTION.Left now to herself, sensations unfelt before filled the heart ofCecilia. All that had passed for a while appeared a dream; her ideaswere indistinct, her memory was confused, her faculties seemed allout of order, and she had but an imperfect consciousness either of thetransaction in which she had just been engaged, or of the promise shehad bound herself to fulfil; even truth from imagination she scarcelycould separate; all was darkness and doubt, inquietude and disorder!But when at length her recollection more clearly returned, and hersituation appeared to her such as it really was, divested alike offalse terrors or delusive expectations, she found herself still furtherremoved from tranquility.Hitherto, though no stranger to sorrow, which the sickness and earlyloss of her friends had first taught her to feel, and which thesubsequent anxiety of her own heart had since instructed her to bear,she had yet invariably possessed the consolation of self-approvingreflections; but the step she was now about to take, all her principlesopposed; it terrified her as undutiful, it shocked her as clandestine,and scarce was Delvile out of sight, before she regretted her consentto it as the loss of her self-esteem, and believed, even if areconciliation took place, the remembrance of a wilful fault wouldstill follow her, blemish in her own eyes the character she had hopedto support, and be a constant allay to her happiness, by telling her howunworthily she had obtained it.Where frailty has never been voluntary, nor error stubborn, where thepride of early integrity is unsubdued, and the first purity of innocenceis inviolate, how fearfully delicate, how Òtremblingly alive,Ó is theconscience of man! strange, that what in its first state is so tender,can in its last become so callous!Compared with the general lot of human misery, Cecilia had sufferednothing; but compared with the exaltation of ideal happiness, she hadsuffered much; willingly, however, would she again have borne all thathad distressed her, experienced the same painful suspence, enduredthe same melancholy parting, and gone through the same cruel task ofcombating inclination with reason, to have relieved her virtuous mindfrom the new-born and intolerable terror of conscientious reproaches.The equity of her notions permitted her not from the earnestness ofDelvile's entreaties to draw any palliation for her consent to hisproposal; she was conscious that but for her own too great facilitythose entreaties would have been ineffectual, since she well knew howlittle from any other of her admirers they would have availed.But chiefly her affliction and repentance hung upon Mrs Delvile, whomshe loved, reverenced and honoured, whom she dreaded to offend, and whomshe well knew expected from her even exemplary virtue. Her praises, herpartiality, her confidence in her character, which hitherto had been herpride, she now only recollected with shame and with sadness. The terrorof the first interview never ceased to be present to her; she shrunkeven in imagination from her wrath-darting eye, she felt stung bypointed satire, and subdued by cold contempt.Yet to disappoint Delvile so late, by forfeiting a promise so positivelyaccorded; to trifle with a man who to her had been uniformly candid,to waver when her word was engaged, and retract when he thought himselfsecure,--honour, justice and shame told her the time was now past.ÒAnd yet is not this,Ó cried she, Òplacing nominal before actual evil?Is it not studying appearance at the expence of reality? If agreeingto wrong is criminal, is not performing it worse? If repentance for illactions calls for mercy, has not repentance for ill intentions a yethigher claim?--And what reproaches from Delvile can be so bitter as myown? What separation, what sorrow, what possible calamity can hang uponmy mind with such heaviness, as the sense of committing voluntary evil?ÓThis thought so much affected her, that, conquering all regret eitherfor Delvile or herself, she resolved to write to him instantly, andacquaint him of the alteration in her sentiments.This, however, after having so deeply engaged herself, was by no meanseasy; and many letters were begun, but not one of them was finished,when a sudden recollection obliged her to give over the attempt,--forshe knew not whither to direct to him.In the haste with which their plan had been formed and settled, it hadnever once occurred to them that any, occasion for writing was likely tohappen. Delvile, indeed, knew that her address would still be the same;and with regard to his own, as his journey to London was to be secret,he purposed not having any fixed habitation. On the day of theirmarriage, and not before, they had appointed to meet at the house of MrsRoberts, in Fetter-Lane, whence they were instantly to proceed to thechurch.She might still, indeed, enclose a letter for him in one to Mrs Hill, tobe delivered to him on the destined morning when he called to claim her;but to fail him at the last moment, when Mr Belfield would have drawn upthe bond, when a licence was procured, the clergyman waiting to performthe ceremony, and Delvile without a suspicion but that the next momentwould unite them for ever, seemed extending prudence into treachery, andpower into tyranny. Delvile had done nothing to merit such treatment, hehad practised no deceit, he had been guilty of no perfidy, he had openedto her his whole heart, and after shewing it without any disguise, theoption had been all her own to accept or refuse him.A ray of joy now broke its way through the gloom of her apprehensions.ÒAh!Ó cried she, ÒI have not, then, any means to recede! an unprovokedbreach of promise at the very moment destined for its performance, wouldbut vary the mode of acting wrong, without approaching nearer to actingright!ÓThis idea for a while not merely calmed but delighted her; to be thewife of Delvile seemed now a matter of necessity, and she soothedherself with believing that to struggle against it were vain.The next morning during breakfast Mr Monckton arrived.Not greater, though winged with joy, had been the expedition of Delvileto open to him his plan, than was his own, though only goaded bydesperation, to make some effort with Cecilia for rendering it abortive.Nor could all his self-denial, the command which he held over hispassions, nor the rigour with which his feelings were made subservientto his interest, in this sudden hour of trial, avail to preserve hisequanimity. The refinements of hypocrisy, and the arts of insinuation,offered advantages too distant, and exacted attentions too subtle, fora moment so alarming; those arts and those attentions he had already formany years practised, with an address the most masterly, and a diligencethe most indefatigable; success had of late seemed to follow histoils; the encreasing infirmities of his wife, the disappointment andretirement of Cecilia, uniting to promise him a conclusion equallyspeedy and happy; when now, by a sudden and unexpected stroke, the sweetsolace of his future cares, the long-projected recompence of his pastsufferings, was to be snatched from him for ever, and by one who,compared with himself, was but the acquaintance of a day.Almost wholly off his guard from the surprise and horror of thisapprehension, he entered the room with such an air of haste andperturbation, that Mrs Charlton and her grand-daughters demanded whatwas the matter.ÒI am come,Ó he answered abruptly, yet endeavouring to recollecthimself, Òto speak with Miss Beverley upon business of some importance.ÓÒMy dear, then,Ó said Mrs Charlton, Òyou had better go with Mr Moncktoninto your dressing-room.ÓCecilia, deeply blushing, arose and led the way; slowly, however, sheproceeded, though urged by Mr Monckton to make speed. Certain of hisdisapprobation, and but doubtfully relieved from her own, she dreaded aconference which on his side, she foresaw, would be all exhortation andreproof, and on hers all timidity and shame.ÒGood God,Ó cried he, ÒMiss Beverley, what is this you have done? boundyourself to marry a man who despises, who scorns, who refuses to ownyou!ÓShocked by this opening, she started, but could make no answer.ÒSee you not,Ó he continued, Òthe indignity which is offered you? Doesthe loose, the flimsy veil with which it is covered, hide it from yourunderstanding, or disguise it from your delicacy?ÓÒI thought not,--I meant not,Ó said she, more and more confounded, Òtosubmit to any indignity, though my pride, in an exigence so peculiar,may give way, for a while, to convenience.ÓÒTo convenience?Ó repeated he, Òto contempt, to derision, toinsolence!Ó--ÒO Mr Monckton!Ó interrupted Cecilia, Òmake not use of such expressions!they are too cruel for me to hear, and if I thought they were just,would make me miserable for life!ÓÒYou are deceived, grossly deceived,Ó replied he, Òif you doubt theirtruth for a moment; they are not, indeed, even decently concealed fromyou; they are glaring as the day, and wilful blindness can alone obscurethem.ÓÒI am sorry, Sir,Ó said Cecilia, whose confusion, at a charge so rough,began now to give way to anger, Òif this is your opinion; and I amsorry, too, for the liberty I have taken in troubling you upon such asubject.ÓAn apology so full of displeasure instantly taught Mr Monckton theerror he was committing, and checking, therefore, the violence of thoseemotions to which his sudden and desperate disappointment gave rise,and which betrayed him into reproaches so unskilful, he endeavouredto recover his accustomed equanimity, and assuming an air of friendlyopenness, said, ÒLet me not offend you, my dear Miss Beverley, by afreedom which results merely from a solicitude to serve you, and whichthe length and intimacy of our acquaintance had, I hoped, long sinceauthorised. I know not how to see you on the brink of destructionwithout speaking, yet, if you are averse to my sincerity, I will curbit, and have done.ÓÒNo, do not have done,Ó cried she, much softened; Òyour sincerity doesme nothing but honour, and hitherto, I am sure, it has done me nothingbut good. Perhaps I deserve your utmost censure; I feared it, indeed,before you came, and ought, therefore, to have better prepared myselffor meeting with it.ÓThis speech completed Mr Monckton's self-victory; it shewed him notonly the impropriety of his turbulence, but gave him room to hope that amildness more crafty would have better success.ÒYou cannot but be certain,Ó he answered, Òthat my zeal proceeds whollyfrom a desire to be of use to you; my knowledge of the world mightpossibly, I thought, assist your inexperience, and the disinterestednessof my regard, might enable me to see and to point out the dangers towhich you are exposed, from artifice and duplicity in those who haveother purposes to answer than what simply belong to your welfare.ÓÒNeither artifice nor duplicity,Ó cried Cecilia, jealous for thehonour of Delvile, Òhave been practised against me. Argument, and notpersuasion, determined me, and if I have done wrong--those who promptedme have erred as unwittingly as myself.ÓÒYou are too generous to perceive the difference, or you would findnothing less alike. If, however, my plainness will not offend you,before it is quite too late, I will point out to you a few of theevils,--for there are some I cannot even mention, which at this instantdo not merely threaten, but await you.ÓCecilia started at this terrifying offer, and afraid to accept, yetashamed to refuse, hung back irresolute.ÒI see,Ó said Mr Monckton, after a pause of some continuance, Òyourdetermination admits no appeal. The consequence must, indeed, be allyour own, but I am greatly grieved to find how little you are aware ofits seriousness. Hereafter you will wish, perhaps, that the friend ofyour earliest youth had been permitted to advise you; at present youonly think him officious and impertinent, and therefore he can donothing you will be so likely to approve as quitting you. I wishyou, then, greater happiness than seems prepared to follow you, and acounsellor more prosperous in offering his assistance.ÓHe would then have taken his leave; but Cecilia called out, ÒOh, MrMonckton! do you then give me up?ÓÒNot unless you wish it.ÓÒAlas, I know not what to wish! except, indeed, the restoration of thatsecurity from self-blame, which till yesterday, even in the midst ofdisappointment, quieted and consoled me.ÓÒAre you, then, sensible you have gone wrong, yet resolute not to turnback?ÓÒCould I tell, could I see,Ó cried she, with energy, Òwhich way I oughtto turn, not a moment would I hesitate how to act! my heart should haveno power, my happiness no choice,--I would recover my own esteem by anysacrifice that could be made!ÓÒWhat, then, can possibly be your doubt? To be as you were yesterdaywhat is wanting but your own inclination?ÓÒEvery thing is wanting; right, honour, firmness, all by which the justare bound, and all which the conscientious hold sacred!ÓÒThese scruples are merely romantic; your own good sense, had it fairerplay, would contemn them; but it is warped at present by prejudice andprepossession.ÓÒNo, indeed!Ó cried she, colouring at the charge, ÒI may have enteredtoo precipitately into an engagement I ought to have avoided, but it isweakness of judgment, not of heart, that disables me from retrieving myerror.ÓÒYet you will neither hear whither it may lead you, nor which way youmay escape from it?ÓÒYes, Sir,Ó cried she, trembling, ÒI am now ready to hear both.ÓÒBriefly, then, I will tell you. It will lead you into a family of whichevery individual will disdain you; it will make you inmate of a house ofwhich no other inmate will associate with you; you will be insulted asan inferior, and reproached as an intruder; your birth will be a subjectof ridicule, and your whole race only named with derision; and whilethe elders of the proud castle treat you with open contempt, the man forwhom you suffer will not dare to support you.ÓÒImpossible! impossible!Ó cried Cecilia, with the most angry emotion;Òthis whole representation is exaggerated, and the latter part isutterly without foundation.ÓÒThe latter part,Ó said Mr Monckton, Òis of all other least disputable;the man who now dares not own, will then never venture to defend you. Onthe contrary, to make peace for himself, he will be the first to neglectyou. The ruined estates of his ancestors will be repaired by yourfortune, while the name which you carry into his family will beconstantly resented as an injury; you will thus be plundered though youare scorned, and told to consider yourself honoured that they condescendto make use of you! nor here rests the evil of a forced connection withso much arrogance,--even your children, should you have any, will beeducated to despise you!ÓÒDreadful and horrible!Ó cried Cecilia;--ÒI can hear no more,--Oh, MrMonckton, what a prospect have you opened to my view!ÓÒFly from it, then, while it is yet in your power,--when two paths arebefore you, chuse not that which leads to destruction; send instantlyafter Delvile, and tell him you have recovered your senses.ÓÒI would long since have sent,--I wanted not a representation such asthis,--but I know not how to direct to him, nor whither he is gone.ÓÒAll art and baseness to prevent your recantation!ÓÒNo, Sir, no,Ó cried she, with quickness; Òwhatever may be the truth ofyour painting in general, all that concerns--ÓAshamed of the vindication she intended, which yet in her own mind wasfirm and animated, she stopt, and left the sentence unfinished.ÒIn what place were you to meet?Ó said Mr Monckton; Òyou can at leastsend to him there.ÓÒWe were only to have met,Ó answered she, in much confusion, Òat thelast moment,--and that would be too late--it would be too--I could not,without some previous notice, break a promise which I gave without anyrestriction.ÓÒIs this your only objection?ÓÒIt is; but it is one which I cannot conquer.ÓÒThen you would give up this ill-boding connection, but from notions ofdelicacy with regard to the time?ÓÒIndeed I meant it, before you came.ÓÒI, then, will obviate this objection; give me but the commission,either verbally or in writing, and I will undertake to find him out, anddeliver it before night.ÓCecilia, little expecting this offer, turned extremely pale, and afterpausing some moments, said in a faultering voice, ÒWhat, then, Sir, isyour advice, in what manner--ÓÒI will say to him all that is necessary; trust the matter with me.ÓÒNo,--he deserves, at least, an apology from myself,--though how to makeit--ÓShe stopt, she hesitated, she went out of the room for pen and ink,she returned without them, and the agitation of her mind every instantencreasing, she begged him, in a faint voice, to excuse her while sheconsulted with Mrs Charlton, and promising to wait upon him again, washurrying away.Mr Monckton, however, saw too great danger in so much emotion to trusther out of his sight; he told her, therefore, that she would onlyencrease her perplexity, without reaping any advantage, by anapplication to Mrs Charlton, and that if she was really sincere inwishing to recede, there was not a moment to be lost, and Delvile shouldimmediately be pursued.Cecilia, sensible of the truth of this speech, and once morerecollecting the unaffected earnestness with which but an hour ortwo before, she had herself desired to renounce this engagement, nowsummoned her utmost courage to her aid, and, after a short, but painfulstruggle, determined to act consistently with her professions and hercharacter, and, by one great and final effort, to conclude all herdoubts, and try to silence even her regret, by completing the triumph offortitude over inclination.She called, therefore, for pen and ink, and without venturing herselffrom the room, wrote the following letter.To Mortimer Delvile, Esq.Accuse me not of caprice, and pardon my irresolution, when you find meshrinking with terror from the promise I have made, and no longer eitherable or willing to perform it. The reproaches of your family I shouldvery ill endure; but the reproaches of my own heart for an action I canneither approve nor defend, would be still more oppressive. With sucha weight upon the mind length of life would be burthensome; with asensation of guilt early death would be terrific! These being my notionsof the engagement into which we have entered, you cannot wonder, and youhave still less reason to repine, that I dare not fulfil it. Alas!where would be your chance of happiness with one who in the very act ofbecoming yours would forfeit her own!I blush at this tardy recantation, and I grieve at the disappointmentit may occasion you; but I have yielded to the exhortations of aninward monitor, who is never to be neglected with impunity. Consulthim yourself, and I shall need no other advocate. Adieu, and may allfelicity attend you! if to hear of the almost total privation of mine,will mitigate the resentment with which you will probably read thisletter, it may be mitigated but too easily! Yet my consent to aclandestine action shall never be repeated; and though I confess toyou I am not happy, I solemnly declare my resolution is unalterable.A little reflection will tell you I am right, though a great deal oflenity may scarce suffice to make you pardon my being right no sooner.C. B.This letter, which with trembling haste, resulting from a fear ofher own steadiness, she folded and sealed, Mr Monckton, from the sameapprehension yet more eagerly received, and scarce waiting to bid hergood morning, mounted his horse, and pursued his way to London.Cecilia returned to Mrs Charlton to acquaint her with what had passed;and notwithstanding the sorrow she felt in apparently injuring the manwhom, in the whole world she most wished to oblige, she yet found asatisfaction in the sacrifice she had made, that recompensed her formuch of her sufferings, and soothed her into something like tranquility;the true power of virtue she had scarce experienced before, for shefound it a resource against the cruellest dejection, and a supporter inthe bitterest disappointment.CHAPTER viii. -- AN EMBARRASSMENT.The day passed on without any intelligence; the next day, also, passedin the same manner, and on the third, which was her birthday, Ceciliabecame of age.The preparations which had long been making among her tenants tocelebrate this event, Cecilia appeared to take some share, andendeavoured to find some pleasure in. She gave a public dinner to allwho were willing to partake of it, she promised redress to those whocomplained of hard usage, she pardoned many debts, and distributedmoney, food, and clothing to the poor. These benevolent occupations madetime seem less heavy, and while they freed her from solitude, divertedher suspense. She still, however, continued at the house of MrsCharlton, the workmen having disappointed her in finishing her own.But, in defiance of her utmost exertion, towards the evening of thisday the uneasiness of her uncertainty grew almost intolerable. The nextmorning she had promised Delvile to set out for London, and he expectedthe morning after to claim her for his wife; yet Mr Monckton neithersent nor came, and she knew not if her letter was delivered, or if stillhe was unprepared for the disappointment by which he was awaited. Asecret regret for the unhappiness she must occasion him, which silentlyyet powerfully reproached her, stole fast upon her mind, and poisonedits tranquility; for though her opinion was invariable in holding hisproposal to be wrong, she thought too highly of his character to believehe would have made it but from a mistaken notion it was right. Shepainted him, therefore, to herself, as glowing with indignation,accusing her of inconsistency, and perhaps suspecting her of coquetry,and imputing her change of conduct to motives the most trifling andnarrow, till with resentment and disdain, he drove her wholly from histhoughts.In a few minutes, however, the picture was reversed; Delvile no moreappeared storming nor unreasonable; his face wore an aspect of sorrow,and his brow was clouded with disappointment; he forbore to reproachher, but the look which her imagination delineated was more piercingthan words of severest import.These images pursued and tormented her, drew tears from her eyes,and loaded her heart with anguish. Yet, when she recollected that herconduct had had in view an higher motive than pleasing Delvile, she feltthat it ought to offer her an higher satisfaction; she tried, therefore,to revive her spirits, by reflecting upon her integrity, and refused allindulgence to this enervating sadness, beyond what the weakness of humannature demands, as some relief to its sufferings upon every fresh attackof misery.A conduct such as this was the best antidote against affliction, whosearrows are never with so little difficulty repelled, as when theylight upon a conscience which no self-reproach has laid bare to theirmalignancy.Before six o'clock the next morning, her maid came to her bedsidewith the following letter, which she told; her had been brought by anexpress.To Miss Beverley.May this letter, with one only from Delvile Castle, be the last thatMiss Beverley may ever receive!Yet sweet to me as is that hope, I write in the utmost uneasiness; Ihave just heard that a gentleman, whom, by the description that is givenof him, I imagine is Mr Monckton, has been in search of me with a letterwhich he was anxious to deliver immediately.Perhaps this letter is from Miss Beverley, perhaps it containsdirections which ought instantly to be followed; could I divinewhat they are, with what eagerness would I study to anticipate theirexecution! It will not, I hope, be too late to receive them on Saturday,when her power over my actions will be confirmed, and when every wishshe will communicate, shall be gratefully, joyfully, and with delightfulfilled.I have sought Belfield in vain; he has left Lord Vannelt, and no oneknows whither he is gone. I have been obliged, therefore, to trust astranger to draw up the bond; but he is a man of good character, and thetime of secrecy will be too short to put his discretion in much danger.To-morrow, Friday, I shall spend solely in endeavouring to discover. MrMonckton; I have leisure sufficient for the search, since so prosperoushas been my diligence, that every thing is prepared!I have seen some lodgings in Pall-Mall, which I think are commodious andwill suit you; send a servant, therefore, before you to secure them. Ifupon your arrival I should venture to meet you there, be not, I beseechyou, offended or alarmed; I shall take every possible precaution neitherto be known nor seen, and I will stay with you only three minutes. Themessenger who carries this is ignorant from whom it comes, for I fearhis repeating my name among your servants, and he could scarce returnto me with an answer before you will yourself be in town. Yes, loveliestCecilia! at the very moment you receive this letter, the chaise will, Iflatter myself, be at the door, which is to bring to me a treasure thatwill enrich every future hour of my life! And oh as to me it will beexhaustless, may but its sweet dispenser experience some share of thehappiness she bestows, and then what, save her own purity, will be soperfect, so unsullied, as the felicity of her! M.D.The perturbation of Cecilia upon reading this letter was unspeakable; MrMonckton, she found, had been wholly unsuccessful, all her heroism hadanswered no purpose, and the transaction was as backward as before shehad exerted it.She was, now, therefore, called upon to think and act entirely forherself. Her opinion was still the same, nor did her resolution waver,yet how to put it in execution she could not discern. To write to himwas impossible, since she was ignorant where he was to be found; todisappoint him at the last moment she could not resolve, since such aconduct appeared to her unfeeling and unjustifiable; for a few instantsshe thought of having him waited for at night in London, with a letter;but the danger of entrusting any one with such a commission, and theuncertainty of finding him, should he disguise himself, made the successof this scheme too precarious for trial.One expedient alone occurred to her, which, though she felt to behazardous, she believed was without an alternative; this was no otherthan hastening to London herself, consenting to the interview he hadproposed in Pall-Mall, and then, by strongly stating her objections,and confessing the grief they occasioned her, to pique at once hisgenerosity and his pride upon releasing her himself from the engagementinto which he had entered.She had no time to deliberate; her plan, therefore, was decided almostas soon as formed, and every moment being precious, she was obligedto awaken Mrs Charlton, and communicate to her at once the letter fromDelvile, and the new resolution she had taken.Mrs Charlton, having no object in view but the happiness of her youngfriend, with a facility that looked not for objections, and scarce sawthem when presented, agreed to the expedition, and kindly consented toaccompany her to London; for Cecilia, however concerned to hurryand fatigue her, was too anxious for the sanction of her presence tohesitate in soliciting it.A chaise, therefore, was ordered; and with posthorses for speed, and twoservants on horseback, the moment Mrs Charlton was ready, they set outon their journey.Scarce had they proceeded two miles on their way, when they were met byMr Monckton, who was hastening to their house.Amazed and alarmed at a sight so unexpected, he stopt the chaise toenquire whither they were going.Cecilia, without answering, asked if her letter had yet been received?ÒI could not,Ó said Mr Monckton, Òdeliver it to a man who was not to befound; I was at this moment coming to acquaint how vainly I had soughthim; but still that your journey is unnecessary unless voluntary, sinceI have left it at the house where you told me you should meet to-morrowmorning, and where he must then unavoidably receive it.ÓÒIndeed, Sir,Ó cried Cecilia, Òto-morrow morning will be too late,--inconscience, in justice, and even in decency too late! I must, therefore,go to town; yet I go not, believe me, in opposition to your injunctions,but to enable myself, without treachery or dishonour, to fulfil them.ÓMr Monckton, aghast and confounded, made not any answer, till Ceciliagave orders to the postilion to drive on; he then hastily called to stophim, and began the warmest expostulations; but Cecilia, firm when shebelieved herself right, though wavering when fearful she was wrong, toldhim it was now too late to change her plan, and repeating her ordersto the postilion, left him to his own reflections; grieved herself toreject his counsel, yet too intently occupied by her own affairs anddesigns, to think long of any other.CHAPTER ix. -- A TORMENT.At----they stopt for dinner; Mrs Charlton being too much fatigued to goon without some rest, though the haste of Cecilia to meet Delvile timeenough for new arranging their affairs, made her regret every momentthat was spent upon the road.Their meal was not long, and they were returning to their chaise, whenthey were suddenly encountered by Mr Morrice, who was just alighted fromhis horse.He congratulated himself upon the happiness of meeting them with the airof a man who nothing doubted that happiness being mutual; then hasteningto speak of the Grove, ÒI could hardly,Ó he cried, Òget away; my friendMonckton won't know what to do without me, for Lady Margaret, poor oldsoul, is in a shocking bad way indeed; there's hardly any staying inthe room with her; her breathing is just like the grunting of a hog.She can't possibly last long, for she's quite upon her last legs, andtumbles about so when she walks alone, one would swear she was drunk.ÓÒIf you take infirmity,Ó said Mrs Charlton, who was now helped into thechaise, Òfor intoxication, you must suppose no old person sober.ÓÒVastly well said, ma'am,Ó cried he; ÒI really forgot your being an oldlady yourself, or I should not have made the observation. However, as topoor Lady Margaret, she may do as well as ever by and bye, for she hasan excellent constitution, and I suppose she has been hardly any betterthan she is now these forty years, for I remember when I was quite a boyhearing her called a limping old puddle.ÓÒWell, we'll discuss this matter, if you please,Ó said Cecilia, Òsomeother time.Ó And ordered the postilion to drive on. But before they cameto their next stage, Morrice having changed his horse, joined them, androde on by their side, begging them to observe what haste he had made onpurpose to have the pleasure of escorting them.This forwardness was very offensive to Mrs Charlton, whose years andcharacter had long procured her more deference and respect; but Cecilia,anxious only to hasten her journey, was indifferent to every thing, savewhat retarded it.At the same Inn they both again changed horses, and he still continuedriding with them, and occasionally talking, till they were withintwenty miles of London, when a disturbance upon the road exciting hiscuriosity, he hastily rode away from them to enquire into its cause.Upon coming up to the place whence it proceeded, they saw a partyof gentlemen on horseback surrounding a chaise which had been justoverturned; and while the confusion in the road obliged the postilion tostop Cecilia heard a lady's voice exclaiming, ÒI declare I dare say I amkilled!Ó and instantly recollecting Miss Larolles, the fear of discoveryand delay made her desire the man to drive on with all speed. He waspreparing to obey her, but Morrice, gallopping after them, calledout, ÒMiss Beverley, one of the ladies that has been overturned, is anacquaintance of yours. I used to see her with you at Mrs Harrel's.ÓÒDid you?Ó said Cecilia, much disconcerted, ÒI hope she is not hurt?'ÒNo, not at all; but the lady with her is bruised to death; won't youcome and see her?ÓÒI am too much in haste at present,--and I can do them no good; but MrsCharlton I am sure will spare her servant, if he can be of any use.ÓÒO but the young lady wants to speak to you; she is coming up to thechaise as fast as ever she can.ÓÒAnd how should she know me?Ó cried Cecilia, with much surprise; ÒI amsure she could not see me.ÓÒO, I told her,Ó, answered Morrice, with a nod of self-approbationfor what he had done, ÒI told her it was you, for I knew I could soonovertake you.ÓDispleasure at this officiousness was unavailing, for looking out ofthe window, she perceived Miss Larolles, followed by half her party, notthree paces from the chaise.ÒO my dear creature,Ó she called out, Òwhat a terrible accident! Iassure you I am so monstrously frightened you've no idea. It's theluckiest thing in the world that you were going this way. Never anything happened so excessively provoking; you've no notion what a fallwe've had. It's horrid shocking, I assure you. How have you been allthis time? You can't conceive how glad I am to see you.ÓÒAnd to which will Miss Beverley answer first,Ó cried a voice whichannounced Mr Gosport, Òthe joy or the sorrow? For so adroitly are theyblended, that a common auditor could with difficulty decide, whethercondolence, or congratulation should have the precedency.ÓÒHow can you be so excessive horrid,Ó cried Miss Larolles, Òto talk ofcongratulation, when one's in such a shocking panic that one does notknow if one's dead or alive!ÓÒDead, then, for any wager,Ó returned he, Òif we may judge by yourstillness.ÓÒI desire, now, you won't begin joking,Ó cried she, Òfor I assure youit's an excessive serious affair. I was never so rejoiced in my life aswhen I found I was not killed. I've been so squeezed you've no notion. Ithought for a full hour I had broke both my arms.ÓÒAnd my heart at the same time,Ó said Mr Gosport; ÒI hope you did notimagine that the least fragile of the three?ÓÒAll our hearts, give me leave to add,Ó said Captain Aresby--just thenadvancing, Òall our hearts must have been abims, by the indispositionof Miss Larolles, had not their doom been fortunately revoked by thesight of Miss Beverley.ÓÒWell, this is excessive odd,Ó, cried Miss Larolles, Òthat every bodyshould run away so from poor Mrs Mears; she'll be so affronted you've noidea. I thought, Captain Aresby, you would have stayed to take care ofher.ÓÒI'll run and see how she is myself,Ó cried Morrice, and away hegallopped.ÒReally, ma'am,Ó said the Captain, ÒI am quite au desespoir to havefailed in any of my devoirs; but I make it a principle to be a merelooker on upon these occasions, lest I should be so unhappy as to commitany faux pas by too much empressement.ÓÒAn admirable caution!Ó said Mr Gosport, Òand, to so ardent a temper, anecessary check!ÓCecilia, whom the surprise and vexation of so unseasonable a meeting,when she particularly wished to have escaped all notice, had hithertokept in painful silence, began now to recover some presence of mind; andmaking her compliments to Miss Larolles and Mr Gosport, with a slightbow to the Captain, she apologized for hurrying away, but told them shehad an engagement in London which could not be deferred, and was thengiving orders to the postilion to drive on, when Morrice returning fullspeed, called out ÒThe poor lady's so bad she is not able to stir astep; she can't put a foot to the ground, and she says she's quite blackand blue; so I told her I was sure Miss Beverley would not refuse tomake room for her in her chaise, till the other can be put to rights;and she says she shall take it as a great favour. Here, postilion, alittle more to the right! come, ladies and gentlemen, get out of theway.Ó This impertinence, however extraordinary, Cecilia could notoppose; for Mrs Charlton, ever compassionate and complying where therewas any appearance of distress, instantly seconded the proposal; thechaise, therefore, was turned back, and she was obliged to offer aplace in it to Mrs Mears, who, though more frightened than hurt, readilyaccepted it, notwithstanding, to make way for her without incommodingMrs Charlton, she was forced to get out herself.She failed not, however, to desire that all possible expedition mightbe used in refitting the other chaise for their reception; and all thegentlemen but one, dismounted their horses, in order to assist, or seemto assist in getting it ready.This only unconcerned spectator in the midst of the apparent generalbustle, was Mr Meadows; who viewed all that passed without troublinghimself to interfere, and with an air of the most evident carelessnesswhether matters went well or went ill.Miss Larolles, now returning to the scene of action, suddenly screamedout, ÒO dear, where's my little dog! I never thought of him, I declare!I love him better than any thing in the world. I would not have him hurtfor a hundred thousand pounds. Lord, where is he?ÓÒCrushed or suffocated in the overturn, no doubt,Ó said Mr Gosport; Òbutas you must have been his executioner, what softer death could he die?If you will yourself inflict the punishment, I will submit to the samefate.ÓÒLord, how you love to plague one!Ó cried she and then enquired amongthe servants what was become of her dog. The poor little animal,forgotten by its mistress, and disregarded by all others, was nowdiscovered by its yelping; and soon found to have been the most materialsufferer by the overturn, one of its fore legs being broken.Could screams or lamentations, reproaches to the servants, or complaintsagainst the Destinies, have abated his pain, or made a callus of thefracture, but short would have been the duration of his misery; forneither words were saved, nor lungs were spared, the very air was rentwith cries, and all present were upbraided as if accomplices in thedisaster.The postilion, at length, interrupted this vociferation with news thatthe chaise was again fit for use; and Cecilia, eager to be gone, findinghim little regarded, repeated what he said to Miss Larolles.ÒThe chaise?Ó cried she, Òwhy you don't suppose I'll ever get into thathorrid chaise any more? I do assure you I would not upon any account.ÓÒNot get into it?Ó said Cecilia, Òfor what purpose, then, have we allwaited till it was ready?ÓÒO, I declare I would not go in it for forty thousand worlds. I wouldrather walk to an inn, if it's a hundred and fifty miles off.ÓÒBut as it happens,Ó said Mr Gosport, Òto be only seven miles, I fancyyou will condescend to ride.ÓÒSeven miles! Lord, how shocking! you frighten me so you have no idea.Poor Mrs Mears! She'll have to go quite alone. I dare say the chaisewill be down fifty times by the way. Ten to one but she breaks her neck!only conceive how horrid! I assure you I am excessive glad I am out ofit.ÓÒVery friendly, indeed!Ó said Mr Gosport. ÒMrs Mears, then, may breakher bones at her leisure!ÓMrs Mears, however, when applied to, professed an equal aversion to thecarriage in which she had been so unfortunate, and declared she wouldrather walk than return to it, though one of her ancles was already soswelled that she could hardly stand.ÒWhy then the best way, ladies,Ó cried Morrice, with the look of a manhappy in vanquishing all difficulties, Òwill be for Mrs Charlton, andthat poor lady with the bruises, to go together in that sound chaise,and then for us gentlemen to escort this young lady and Miss Beverleyon foot, till we all come to the next inn. Miss Beverley, I know, is anexcellent walker, for I have heard Mr Monckton say so.ÓCecilia, though in the utmost consternation at a proposal, which must solong retard a journey she had so many reasons to wish hastened, knew nothow either in decency or humanity to oppose it; and the fear of raisingsuspicion, from a consciousness how much there was to suspect, forcedher to curb her impatience, and reduced her even to repeat the offerwhich Morrice had made, though she could scarce look at him for anger athis unseasonable forwardness.No voice dissenting, the troop began to be formed. The foot consisted ofthe two young ladies, and Mr Gosport, who alighted to walk with Cecilia;the cavalry, of Mr Meadows, the Captain, and Morrice, who walked theirhorses a foot pace, while the rest of the party rode on with the chaise,as attendants upon Mrs Mears.Just before they set off, Mr Meadows, riding negligently up to thecarriage, exerted himself so far as to say to Mrs Mears, ÒAre you hurt,ma'am?Ó and, at the same instant, seeming to recollect Cecilia, heturned about, and yawning while he touched his hat, said, ÒO, howd'ye do, ma'am?Ó and then, without waiting an answer to either of hisquestions, flapped it over his eyes, and joined the cavalcade, thoughwithout appearing to have any consciousness that he belonged to it.Cecilia would most gladly have used the rejected chaise herself, butcould not make such a proposal to Mrs Charlton, who was past the ageand the courage for even any appearance of enterprize. Upon enquiry,however, she had the satisfaction to hear that the distance to the nextstage was but two miles, though multiplied to seven by the malice of MrGosport.Miss Larolles carried her little dog in her arms, declaring she wouldnever more trust him a moment away from her. She acquainted Cecilia thatshe had been for some time upon a visit to Mrs Mears, who, with the restof the party, had taken her to see--house and gardens, where they hadmade an early dinner, from which they were just returning home when thechaise broke down.She then proceeded, with her usual volubility, to relate the littlenothings that had passed since the winter, flying from subject tosubject, with no meaning but to be heard, and no wish but to talk, everrapid in speech, though minute in detail. This loquacity met not withany interruption, save now and then a sarcastic remark, from Mr Gosport;for Cecilia was too much occupied by her own affairs, to answer orlisten to such uninteresting discourse.Her silence, however, was at length forcibly broken; Mr Gosport, takingadvantage of the first moment Miss Larolles stopt for breath, said,ÒPray what carries you to town, Miss Beverley, at this time of theyear?ÓCecilia, whose thoughts had been wholly employed upon what would passat her approaching meeting with Delvile, was so entirely unprepared forthis question, that she could make to it no manner of answer, till MrGosport, in a tone of some surprise, repeated it, and then, not withouthesitation, she said, ÒI have some business, Sir, in London,--pray howlong have you been in the country?ÓÒBusiness, have you?Ó cried he, struck by her evasion; Òand pray whatcan you and business have in common?ÓÒMore than you may imagine,Ó answered she, with greater steadiness; Òandperhaps before long I may even have enough to teach me the enjoyment ofleisure.ÓÒWhy you don't pretend to play my Lady Notable, and become your ownsteward?ÓÒAnd what can I do better?ÓÒWhat? Why seek one ready made to take the trouble off your hands. Thereare such creatures to be found, I promise you; beasts of burthen, whowill freely undertake the management of your estate, for no other rewardthan the trifling one of possessing it. Can you no where meet with suchan animal?ÓÒI don't know,Ó answered she, laughing, ÒI have not been looking out.ÓÒAnd have none such made application to you?ÓÒWhy no,--I believe not.ÓÒFie, fie! no register-office keeper has been pestered with moreclaimants. You know they assault you by dozens.ÓÒYou must pardon me, indeed, I know not any such thing.ÓÒYou know, then, why they do not, and that is much the same.ÓÒI may conjecture why, at least; the place, I suppose, is not worth theservice.ÓÒNo, no; the place, they conclude, is already seized, and thefee--simple of the estate is the heart of the owner. Is it not so?ÓÒThe heart of the owner,Ó answered she, a little confused, Òmay, indeed,be simple, but not, perhaps, so easily seized as you imagine.ÓÒHave you, then, wisely saved it from a storm, by a generous surrender?you have been, indeed, in an excellent school for the study both ofattack and defence; Delvile-Castle is a fortress which, even in ruins,proves its strength by its antiquity; and it teaches, also, an admirablelesson, by displaying the dangerous, the infallible power of time, whichdefies all might, and undermines all strength; which breaks down everybarrier, and shews nothing endurable but itself.Ó Then looking at herwith an arch earnestness, ÒI think,Ó he added, Òyou made a long visitthere; did this observation never occur to you? did you never perceive,never feel, rather, the insidious properties of time?ÓÒYes, certainly,Ó answered she, alarmed at the very mention ofDelvile Castle, yet affecting to understand literally what was saidmetaphorically, Òthe havoc of time upon the place could not failstriking me.ÓÒAnd was its havoc,Ó said he, yet more archly, Òmerely external? is allwithin safe? sound and firm? and did the length of your residence shewits power by no new mischief?ÓÒDoubtless, not,Ó answered she, with the same pretended ignorance, Òtheplace is not in so desperate a condition as to exhibit any visible marksof decay in the course of three or four months.ÓÒAnd, do you not know,Ó cried he, Òthat the place to which I allude mayreceive a mischief in as many minutes which double the number of yearscannot rectify? The internal parts of a building are not less vulnerableto accident than its outside; and though the evil may more easily beconcealed, it will with greater difficulty be remedied. Many a fairstructure have I seen, which, like that now before meÓ (looking withmuch significance at Cecilia), Òhas to the eye seemed perfect in all itsparts, and unhurt either by time or casualty, while within, some lurkingevil, some latent injury, has secretly worked its way into the veryheart of the edifice, where it has consumed its strength, and laid wasteits powers, till, sinking deeper and deeper, it has sapped its veryfoundation, before the superstructure has exhibited any token of danger.Is such an accident among the things you hold to be possible?ÓÒYour language,Ó said she, colouring very high, Òis so florid, that Imust own it renders your meaning rather obscure.ÓÒShall I illustrate it by an example? Suppose, during your abode inDelvile Castle?ÓÒNo, no,Ó interrupted she, with involuntary quickness, Òwhy should Itrouble you to make illustrations?ÓÒO pray, my dear creature,Ó cried Miss Larolles, Òhow is Mrs Harrel? Iwas never so sorry for any body in my life. I quite forgot to ask afterher.ÓÒAy, poor Harrel!Ó cried Morrice, Òhe was a great loss to his friends.I had just begun to have a regard for him; we were growing extremelyintimate. Poor fellow! he really gave most excellent dinners.ÓÒHarrel?Ó suddenly exclaimed Mr Meadows, who seemed just then to firsthear what was going forward, Òwho was he?ÓÒO, as good-natured a fellow as ever I knew in my life,Ó answeredMorrice; Òhe was never out of humour; he was drinking and singing anddancing to the very last moment. Don't you remember him, Sir, that nightat Vauxhall?ÓMr Meadows made not any answer, but rode languidly on.Morrice, ever more flippant than sagacious, called out, ÒI reallybelieve the gentleman's deaf! he won't so much as say umph, and hay,now; but I'll give him such a hallow in his ears, as shall make him hearme, whether he will or no. Sir! I say!Ó bawling aloud, Òhave you forgotthat night at Vauxhall?ÓMr Meadows, starting at being thus shouted at, looked towards Morricewith some surprise, and said, ÒWere you so obliging, Sir, as to speak tome?ÓÒLord, yes, Sir,Ó said Morrice, amazed; ÒI thought you had askedsomething about Mr Harrel, so I just made an answer to it;--that's all.ÓÒSir, you are very good,Ó returned he, slightly bowing, and then lookinganother way, as if thoroughly satisfied with what had passed.ÒBut I say, Sir,Ó resumed Morrice, Òdon't you remember how Mr HarrelÓ--ÒMr who, Sir?ÓÒMr Harrel, Sir; was not you just now asking me who he was?ÓÒO, ay, true,Ó cried Meadows, in a tone of extreme weariness, ÒI am muchobliged to you. Pray give my respects to him.Ó And, touching his hat, hewas riding away; but the astonished Morrice called out, ÒYour respectsto him? why lord! Sir, don't you know he's dead?ÓÒDead?--who, Sir?ÓÒWhy Mr Harrel, Sir.ÓÒHarrel?--O, very true,Ó cried Meadows, with a face of suddenrecollection; Òhe shot himself, I think, or was knocked down, orsomething of that sort. I remember it perfectly.ÓÒO pray,Ó cried Miss Larolles, Òdon't let's talk about it, it's thecruellest thing I ever knew in my life. I assure you I was so shocked,I thought I should never have got the better of it. I remember the nextnight at Ranelagh I could talk of nothing else. I dare say I told itto 500 people. I assure you I was tired to death; only conceive howdistressing!ÓÒAn excellent method,Ó cried Mr Gosport, Òto drive it out of your ownhead, by driving it into the heads of your neighbours! But were you notafraid, by such an ebullition of pathos, to burst as many hearts as youhad auditors?ÓÒO I assure you,Ó cried she, Òevery body was so excessive shocked you'veno notion; one heard of nothing else; all the world was raving mad aboutit.ÓÒReally yes,Ó cried the Captain; Òthe subject was obsed upon onepartout. There was scarce any breathing for it; it poured from alldirections; I must confess I was aneanti with it to a degree.ÓÒBut the most shocking thing in nature,Ó cried Miss Larolles, Òwas goingto the sale. I never missed a single day. One used to meet the wholeworld there, and every body was so sorry you can't conceive. It wasquite horrid. I assure you I never suffered so much before; it made meso unhappy you can't imagine.ÓÒThat I am most ready to grant,Ó said Mr Gosport, Òbe the powers ofimagination ever so eccentric.ÓÒSir Robert Floyer and Mr Marriot,Ó continued Miss Larolles, Òhavebehaved so ill you've no idea, for they have done nothing ever since butsay how monstrously Mr Harrel had cheated them, and how they lost suchimmense sums by him;--only conceive how ill-natured!ÓÒAnd they complain,Ó cried Morrice, Òthat old Mr Delvile used themworse; for that when they had been defrauded of all that money onpurpose to pay their addresses to Miss Beverley, he would never let themsee her, but all of a sudden took her off into the country, on purposeto marry her to his own son.ÓThe cheeks of Cecilia now glowed with the deepest blushes; but findingby a general silence that she was expected to make some answer, shesaid, with what unconcern she could assume, ÒThey were very muchmistaken; Mr Delvile had no such view.ÓÒIndeed?Ó cried Mr Gosport, again perceiving her change of countenance;Òand is it possible you have actually escaped a siege, while every bodyconcluded you taken by assault? Pray where is young Delvile at present?ÓÒI don't--I can't tell, Sir.ÓÒIs it long since you have seen him?ÓÒIt is two months,Ó answered she, with yet more hesitation, Òsince I wasat Delvile Castle.ÓÒO, but,Ó cried Morrice, Òdid not you see him while he was in Suffolk?I believe, indeed, he is there now, for it was only yesterday I heard ofhis coming down, by a gentleman who called upon Lady Margaret, and toldus he had seen a stranger, a day or two ago, at Mrs Charlton's door, andwhen he asked who he was, they told him his name was Delvile, and saidhe was on a visit at Mr Biddulph's.ÓCecilia was quite confounded by this speech; to have it known thatDelvile had visited her, was in itself alarming, but to have her ownequivocation thus glaringly exposed, was infinitely more dangerous. Thejust suspicions to which it must give rise filled her with dread, andthe palpable evasion in which she had been discovered, overwhelmed, herwith confusion.ÒSo you had forgotten,Ó said Mr Gosport, looking at her with mucharchness, Òthat you had seen him within the two months? but no wonder;for where is the lady who having so many admirers, can be at the troubleto remember which of them she saw last? or who, being so accustomedto adulation, can hold it worth while to enquire whence it comes? Athousand Mr Delviles are to Miss Beverley but as one; used from themall to the same tale, she regards them not individually as lovers, butcollectively as men; and to gather, even from herself, which she ismost inclined to favour, she must probably desire, like Portia in theMerchant of Venice, that their names may be run over one by one, beforeshe can distinctly tell which is which.ÓThe gallant gaiety of this speech was some relief to Cecilia, who wasbeginning a laughing reply, when Morrice called out, ÒThat man looks asif he was upon the scout.Ó And, raising her eyes, she perceived a manon horseback, who, though much muffled up, his hat flapped, and ahandkerchief held to his mouth and chin, she instantly, by his air andfigure, recognized to be Delvile.In much consternation at this sight, she forgot what she meant to say,and dropping her eyes, walked silently on. Mr Gosport, attentive to hermotions, looked from her to the horseman, and after a short examination,said, ÒI think I have seen that man before; have you, Miss Beverley?ÓÒMe?--no,Ó--answered she, ÒI believe not,--I hardly indeed, see himnow.ÓÒI have, I am pretty sure,Ó said Morrice; Òand if I could see his face,I dare say I should recollect him.ÓÒHe seems very willing to know if he can recollect any of us,Ó saidMr Gosport, Òand, if I am not mistaken, he sees much better than he isseen.ÓHe was now come up to them, and though a glance sufficed to discoverthe object of his search, the sight of the party with which she wassurrounded made him not dare stop or speak to her, and therefore,clapping spurs to his horse, he galloped past them.ÒSee,Ó cried Morrice, looking after him, Òhow he turns round to examineus! I wonder who he is.ÓÒPerhaps some highwayman!Ó cried Miss Larolles; ÒI assure you I am in aprodigious fright; I should hate to be robbed so you can't think.ÓÒI was going to make much the same conjecture,Ó said Mr Gosport, Òand,if I am not greatly deceived, that man is a robber of no common sort.What think you, Miss Beverley, can you discern a thief in disguise?ÓÒNo, indeed; I pretend to no such extraordinary knowledge.ÓÒThat's true; for all that you pretend to is extraordinary ignorance.ÓÒI have a good mind,Ó said Morrice, Òto ride after him, and see what heis about.ÓÒWhat for?Ó exclaimed Cecilia, greatly alarmed Òthere can certainly beno occasion!ÓÒNo, pray don't,Ó cried Miss Larolles, Òfor I assure you if he shouldcome back to rob us, I should die upon the spot. Nothing could be sodisagreeable I should scream so, you've no idea.ÓMorrice then gave up the proposal, and they walked quietly on;but Cecilia was extremely disturbed by this accident; she readilyconjectured that, impatient for her arrival, Delvile had ridden thatway, to see what had retarded her, and she was sensible that nothingcould be so desirable as an immediate explanation of the motive of herjourney. Such a meeting, therefore, had she been alone, was just whatshe could have wished, though, thus unluckily encompassed, it only addedto her anxiety.Involuntarily, however, she quickened her pace, through her eagerness tobe relieved from so troublesome a party; but Miss Larolles, who was inno such haste, protested she could not keep up with her; saying, ÒYoudon't consider that I have got this sweet little dog to carry, and heis such a shocking plague to me you've no notion. Only conceive what aweight he is!ÓÒPray, ma'am,Ó cried Morrice, Òlet me take him for you; I'll be verycareful of him, I promise you; and you need not be afraid to trust me,for I understand more about dogs than about any thing.ÓMiss Larolles, after many fond caresses, being really weary, consented,and Morrice placed the little animal before him on horseback; but whilethis matter was adjusting, and Miss Larolles was giving directions howshe would have it held, Morrice exclaimed, ÒLook, look! that man iscoming back! He is certainly watching us. There! now he's going offagain!--I suppose he saw me remarking him.ÓÒI dare say he's laying in wait to rob us,Ó said Miss Larolles; Òsowhen we turn off the high road, to go to Mrs Mears, I suppose he'll comegalloping after us. It's excessive horrid, I assure you.ÓÒ'Tis a petrifying thing,Ó said the captain, Òthat one must always bedegout by some wretched being or other of this sort; but pray be notderanged, I will ride after him, if you please, and do mon possible toget rid of him.ÓÒIndeed I wish you would,Ó answered Miss Larolles, Òfor I assure you hehas put such shocking notions into my head, it's quite disagreeable.ÓÒI shall make it a principle,Ó said the captain, Òto have the honourof obeying you.Ó And was riding off, when Cecilia, in great agitation,called out ÒWhy should you go, Sir?--he is not in our way,--pray let himalone,--for what purpose should you pursue him?ÓÒI hope,Ó said Mr Gosport, Òfor the purpose of making him join ourcompany, to some part of which I fancy he would be no very intolerableaddition.ÓThis speech again silenced Cecilia, who perceived, with the utmostconfusion, that both Delvile and herself were undoubtedly suspected byMr Gosport, if not already actually betrayed to him. She was obliged,therefore, to let the matter take its course, though quite sick withapprehension lest a full discovery should follow the projected pursuit.The Captain, who wanted not courage, however deeply in vanity andaffectation he had buried common sense, stood suspended, upon therequest of Cecilia, that he would not go, and, with a shrug of distress,said, ÒGive me leave to own I am parfaitment in a state the mostaccablant in the world; nothing could give me greater pleasure than toprofit of the occasion to accommodate either of these ladies; but asthey proceed upon different principles, I am indecid to a degree whichway to turn myself!ÓÒPut it to the vote, then,Ó said Morrice; Òthe two ladies have bothspoke; now, then, for the gentlemen. Come, Sir,Ó to Mr Gosport, Òwhatsay you?ÓÒO, fetch the culprit back, by all means,Ó answered he; Òand then letus all insist upon his opening his cause, by telling us in what he hasoffended us; for there is no part of his business, I believe, with whichwe are less acquainted.ÓÒWell,Ó said Morrice, ÒI'm for asking him a few questions too; so is theCaptain; so every body has spoke but you, Sir,Ó addressing himself to MrMeadows, ÒSo now, Sir, let's hear your opinion.ÓMr Meadows, appearing wholly inattentive, rode on.ÒWhy, Sir, I say!Ó cried Morrice, louder, Òwe are all waiting for yourvote. Pray what is the gentleman's name? it's deuced hard to make himhear one.ÓÒHis name is Meadows,Ó said Miss Larolles, in a low voice, Òand Iassure you sometimes he won't hear people by the hour together. He'sso excessive absent you've no notion. One day he made me so mad, that Icould not help crying; and Mr Sawyer was standing by the whole time! andI assure you I believe he laughed at me. Only conceive how distressing!ÓÒMay be,Ó said Morrice, Òit's out of bashfulness perhaps he thinks weshall cut him up.ÓÒBashfulness,Ó repeated Miss Larolles; ÒLord, you don't conceive thething at all. Why he's at the very head of the ton. There's nothing inthe world so fashionable as taking no notice of things, and never seeingpeople, and saying nothing at all, and never hearing a word, and notknowing one's own acquaintance. All the ton people do so, and I assureyou as to Mr Meadows, he's so excessively courted by every body, that ifhe does but say a syllable, he thinks it such an immense favour, you'veno idea.ÓThis account, however little alluring in itself, of his celebrity,was yet sufficient to make Morrice covet his further acquaintance; forMorrice was ever attentive to turn his pleasure to his profit, andnever negligent of his interest, but when ignorant how to pursue it.He returned, therefore, to the charge, though by no means with the samefreedom he had begun it, and lowering his voice to a tone of respectand submission, he said, ÒPray, Sir, may we take the liberty to ask youradvice, whether we shall go on, or take a turn back?ÓMr Meadows made not any answer; but when Morrice was going to repeathis question, without appearing even to know that he was near him, heabruptly said to Miss Larolles, ÒPray what is become of Mrs Mears? Idon't see her amongst us.ÓÒLord, Mr Meadows,Ó exclaimed she, Òhow can you be so odd? Don't youremember she went on in a chaise to the inn?ÓÒO, ay, true,Ó cried he; ÒI protest I had quite forgot it; I beg yourpardon, indeed. Yes, I recollect now,--she fell off her horse.ÓÒHer horse? Why you know she was in her chaise.ÓÒHer chaise, was it?--ay, true, so it was. Poor thing!--I am glad shewas not hurt.ÓÒNot hurt? Why she's so excessively bruised, she can't stir a step! Onlyconceive what a memory you've got!ÓÒI am most extremely sorry for her indeed,Ó cried he, again stretchinghimself and yawning; Òpoor soul!--I hope she won't die. Do you think shewill!ÓÒDie!Ó repeated Miss Larolles, with a scream, ÒLord, how shocking! Youare really enough to frighten one to hear you.ÓÒBut, Sir,Ó said Morrice, ÒI wish you would be so kind as to give usyour vote; the man will else be gone so far, we sha'n't be able toovertake him.--Though I do really believe that is the very fellow comingback to peep at us again!ÓÒI am ennuy to a degree,Ó cried the Captain; Òhe is certainly set uponus as a spy, and I must really beg leave to enquire of him upon whatprinciple he incommodes us.Ó--And instantly he rode after him.ÒAnd so will I too,Ó cried Morrice, following.Miss Larolles screamed after him to give her first her little dog; butwith a schoolboy's eagerness to be foremost, he galloped on withoutheeding her.The uneasiness of Cecilia now encreased every moment; the discoveryof Delvile seemed unavoidable, and his impatient and indiscreetwatchfulness must have rendered the motives of his disguise but tooglaring. All she had left to hope was arriving at the inn beforethe detection was announced, and at least saving herself the cruelmortification of hearing the raillery which would follow it.Even this, however, was not allowed her; Miss Larolles, whom she hadno means to quit, hardly stirred another step, from her anxiety forher dog, and the earnestness of her curiosity about the stranger. Sheloitered, stopt now to talk, and now to listen, and was scarce moved ayard from the spot where she had been left, when the Captain and Morricereturned.ÒWe could not for our lives overtake the fellow,Ó said Morrice; Òhe waswell mounted, I promise you, and I'll warrant he knows what he's about,for he turned off so short at a place where there were two narrow lanes,that we could not make out which way he went.ÓCecilia, relieved and delighted by this unexpected escape, now recoveredher composure, and was content to saunter on without repining.ÒBut though we could not seize his person,Ó said the Captain, Òwe havedebarrassed ourselves tout  fait from his pursuit; I hope, therefore,Miss Larolles will make a revoke of her apprehensions.ÓThe answer to this was nothing but a loud scream, with an exclamation,ÒLord, where's my dog?ÓÒYour dog!Ó cried Morrice, looking aghast, Ògood stars! I never thoughtof him!ÓÒHow excessive barbarous!Ó cried Miss Larolles, Òyou've killed him,I dare say. Only think how shocking! I had rather have seen any bodyserved so in the world. I shall never forgive it, I assure you.ÓÒLord, ma'am,Ó said Morrice, Òhow can you suppose I've killed him? Poor,pretty creature, I'm sure I liked him prodigiously. I can't think for mylife where he can be; but I have a notion he must have dropt down somewhere while I happened to be on the full gallop. I'll go look [for] him,however, for we went at such a rate that I never missed him.ÓAway again rode Morrice.ÒI am abim to the greatest degree,Ó said the Captain, Òthat the poorlittle sweet fellow should be lost if I had thought him in any danger,I would have made it a principle to have had a regard to his personmyself. Will you give me leave, ma'am, to have the honour of seeking himpartout?ÓÒO, I wish you would with all my heart; for I assure you if I don't findhim, I shall think it so excessive distressing you can't conceive.ÓThe Captain touched his hat, and was gone.These repeated impediments almost robbed Cecilia of all patience; yether total inability of resistance obliged her to submit, and compelledher to go, stop, or turn, according to their own motions.ÒNow if Mr Meadows had the least good-nature in the world,Ó said MissLarolles, Òhe would offer to help us; but he's so excessive odd, that Ibelieve if we were all of us to fall down and break our necks, he wouldbe so absent he would hardly take the trouble to ask us how we did.ÓÒWhy in so desperate a case,Ó said Mr Gosport, Òthe trouble would berather superfluous. However, don't repine that one of the cavaliersstays with us by way of guard, lest your friend the spy should take usby surprize while our troop is dispersed.ÓÒO Lord,Ó cried Miss Larolles, Ònow you put it in my head, I dare saythat wretch has got my dog! only think how horrid!ÓÒI saw plainly,Ó said Mr Gosport, looking significantly at Cecilia,Òthat he was feloniously inclined, though I must confess I took him notfor a dog-stealer.ÓMiss Larolles then, running up to Mr Meadows, called out, ÒI have aprodigious immense favour to ask of you, Mr Meadows.ÓÒMa'am!Ó cried Mr Meadows, with his usual start.ÒIt's only to know, whether if that horrid creature should come back,you could not just ride up to him and shoot him, before he gets to us?Now will you promise me to do it?ÓÒYou are vastly good,Ó said he, with a vacant smile; Òwhat a charmingevening! Do you love the country?ÓÒYes, vastly; only I'm so monstrously tired, I can hardly stir a step.Do you like it?ÓÒThe country? O no! I detest it! Dusty hedges, and chirping sparrows!'Tis amazing to me any body can exist upon such terms.ÓÒI assure you,Ó cried Miss Larolles, ÒI'm quite of your opinion. I hatethe country so you've no notion. I wish with all my heart it was allunder ground. I declare, when I first go into it for the summer, I cryso you can't think. I like nothing but London.--Don't you?ÓÒLondon!Ó repeated Mr Meadows, ÒO melancholy! the sink of all vice anddepravity. Streets without light! Houses without air! Neighbourhoodwithout society! Talkers without listeners!--'Tis astonishing anyrational being can endure to be so miserably immured.ÓÒLord, Mr Meadows,Ó cried she, angrily, ÒI believe you would have onelive no where!ÓÒTrue, very true, ma'am,Ó said he, yawning, Òone really lives no where;one does but vegetate, and wish it all at an end. Don't you find it so,ma'am?ÓÒMe? no indeed; I assure you I like living of all things. Whenever I'mill, I'm in such a fright you've no idea. I always think I'm going todie, and it puts me so out of spirits you can't think. Does not it you,too?ÓHere Mr Meadows, looking another way, began to whistle.ÒLord,Ó cried Miss Larolles, Òhow excessive distressing! to ask onequestions, and then never hear what one answers!ÓHere the Captain returned alone; and Miss Larolles, flying to meet him,demanded where was her dog?ÒI have the malbeur to assure you,Ó answered he, Òthat I never was moreaneanti in my life! the pretty little fellow has broke another leg!ÓMiss Larolles, in a passion of grief, then declared she was certain thatMorrice had maimed him thus on purpose, and desired to know where thevile wretch was?ÒHe was so much discomposed at the incident,Ó replied the Captain, Òthathe rode instantly another way. I took up the pretty fellow thereforemyself, and have done mon possible not to derange him.ÓThe unfortunate little animal was then delivered to Miss Larolles;and after much lamentation, they at length continued their walk; and,without further adventure, arrived at the inn.BOOK VIII.CHAPTER iAN INTERRUPTION.But here, instead of finding, as she expected, Mrs Charlton, and freshhorses in readiness, Cecilia saw neither chaise nor preparation; MrsCharlton was quietly seated in a parlour, and drinking tea with MrsMears.Vexed and disappointed, she ordered horses immediately to the chaise,and entreated Mrs Charlton to lose no more time. But the various delayswhich had already retarded them, had made it now so late that it wasimpossible to get into London by daylight, and Mrs Charlton not havingcourage to be upon the road after dark, had settled to sleep at the inn,and purposed not to proceed till the next morning.Half distracted at this new difficulty, Cecilia begged to speak withher alone, and then represented in the most earnest manner, the absolutenecessity there was for her being in London that night; ÒEvery thing,Ó said she, Òdepends upon it, and the whole purpose of my journey willotherwise be lost, for Mr Delvile will else think himself extremely illused, and to make him reparation, I may be compelled to submit to almostwhatever terms he shall propose.ÓMrs Charlton, kind and yielding, withstood not this entreaty, whichCecilia made with infinite pain to herself, from the reluctance she feltto pursuing her own interest and inclination in opposition to those ofher worthy old friend; but as she was now circumstanced, she consideredthe immediate prosecution of her journey as her only resource againstfirst irritating Delvile by an abrupt disappointment, and appeasinghim next by a concession which would make that disappointment end innothing.The chaise was soon ready, and Mrs Charlton and Cecilia were rising totake leave of the company, when a man and horse galloped full speed intothe inn-yard, and in less than a minute, Morrice bounced into the room.ÒLadies and gentlemen,Ó cried he, quite out of breath with haste, ÒIhave got some news for you! I've just found out who that person is thathas been watching us.ÓCecilia, starting at this most unwelcome intelligence, would now haverun into the chaise without hearing him proceed; but Mrs Charlton, whoknew neither whom nor what he meant, involuntarily stopt, and Cecilia,whose arm she leant upon, was compelled to stay.Every one else eagerly desired to know who he was.ÒWhy I'll tell you,Ó said he, Òhow I found him out. I was thinking inmy own mind what I could possibly do to make amends for that unluckyaccident about the dog, and just then I spied the very man that had mademe drop him; so I thought at least I'd find out who he was. I rode up tohim so quick that he could not get away from me, though I saw plainly itwas the thing he meant. But still he kept himself muffled up, just ashe did before. Not so snug, thought I, my friend, I shall have you yet!It's a fine evening, Sir, says I; but he took no notice; so then I camemore to the point; Sir, says I, I think, I have had the pleasure ofseeing you, though I quite forget where. Still he made no answer; if youhave no objection, Sir, says I, I shall be glad to ride with you, forthe night's coming on, and we have neither of us a servant. But then,without a word speaking, he rode on the quicker. However, I jogged byhis side, as fast as he, and said, Pray Sir, did you know anything ofthat company you were looking at so hard just now? And at this he couldhold out no longer; he turned to me in a most fierce passion, and saidPray, Sir, don't be troublesome. And then he got off; for when I foundby his voice who he was, I let him alone.ÓCecilia, who could bear to hear no more, again hastened Mrs Charlton,who now moved, on; but Morrice, stepping between them both and the door,said, ÒNow do pray, Miss Beverley, guess who it was.ÓÒNo indeed, I cannot,Ó said she, in the utmost confusion, ÒNor have Iany time to hear. Come, dear madam, we shall be very late indeed.ÓÒO but I must tell you before you go;--why it was young Mr Delvile! thesame that I saw with you one night at the Pantheon, and that I used tomeet last spring at Mr Harrel's.ÓÒMr Delvile!Ó repeated every one; Òvery strange he should not speak.ÓÒPray, ma'am,Ó continued Morrice, Òis it not the same gentleman that wasat Mr Biddulph's?ÓCecilia, half dead with shame and vexation, stammered out ÒNo, no,--Ibelieve not,--I can't tell;--I have not a moment to spare.ÓAnd then, at last, got Mrs Charlton out of the room, and into thechaise. But thither, before she could drive off, she was followed by MrGosport, who gravely came to offer his advice that she would immediatelylodge an information at the Public Office at Bow Street, that a verysuspicious looking man had been observed loitering in those parts,who appeared to harbour most dangerous designs against her person andproperty.Cecilia was too much confounded to rally or reply, and Mr Gosportreturned to his party with his speech unanswered.The rest of the journey was without any new casualty, for late as itwas, they escaped being robbed; but neither robbers nor new casualtieswere wanting to make it unpleasant to Cecilia; the incidents which hadalready happened sufficed for that purpose; and the consciousness ofbeing so generally betrayed, added to the delay of her recantation,prepared her for nothing but mortifications to herself, and conflictswith Delvile the most bitter and severe.It was near ten o'clock before they arrived in Pall-Mall. The house towhich Delvile had given directions was easily found, and the servantsent forward had prepared the people of it for their reception.In the cruellest anxiety and trepidation, Cecilia then counted everymoment till Delvile came. She planned an apology for her conduct withall the address of which she was mistress, and determined to bear hisdisappointment and indignation with firmness; yet the part she hadto act was both hard and artificial; she sighed to have it over, andrepined she must have it at all.The instant there was a knock at the door, she flew out upon the stairsto listen; and hearing his well-known voice enquiring for the ladies whohad just taken the lodgings, she ran back to Mrs Charlton, saying, ÒAh,madam, assist me I entreat! for now must I merit, or forfeit your esteemfor ever!ÓÒCan you pardon,Ó cried Delvile, as he entered the room, Òan intrusionwhich was not in our bond? But how could I wait till to-morrow, when Iknew you were in town to-night?ÓHe then made his compliments to Mrs Charlton, and, after enquiringhow she had borne her journey, turned again to Cecilia, whose uneasysensations he saw but too plainly in her countenance; ÒAre you angry,Ó cried he, anxiously, Òthat I have ventured to come hither to-night?ÓÒNo,Ó answered she, struggling with all her feelings for composure;Òwhat we wish is easily excused; and I am glad to see you to-night,because otherwise--ÓShe hesitated; and Delvile, little imagining why, thanked her in thewarmest terms for her condescension. He then related how he had beentormented by Morrice, enquired why Mr Monckton had not accompanied her,and what could possibly have induced her to make her journey so late,or, with so large a party, to be walking upon the high road instead ofhastening to London.ÒI wonder not,Ó answered she, more steadily, Òat your surprise, thoughI have now no time to lessen it. You have never, I find, received myletter?ÓÒNo,Ó cried he, much struck by her manner; Òwas it to forbid our meetingtill to-morrow?ÓÒTo-morrow!Ó she repeated expressively, Òno; it was to forbid--ÓHere the door was suddenly opened, and Morrice burst into the room.The dismay and astonishment of Delvile at sight of him could only beequalled by the confusion and consternation of Cecilia; but Morrice,perceiving neither, abruptly called out ÒMiss Beverley, I quite beg yourpardon for coming so late, but you must knowÓ--then stopping short uponseeing Delvile, ÒGood lord,Ó he exclaimed, Òif here is not our gentlemanspy! Why, Sir, you have not spared the spur! I left you galloping offquite another way.ÓÒHowever that may be Sir,Ó cried Delvile, equally enraged at theinterruption and the observation, Òyou did not, I presume, wait uponMiss Beverley to talk of me?ÓÒNo, Sir,Ó answered he, lightly, Òfor I had told her all about you atthe inn. Did not I, Miss Beverley? Did not I tell you I was sure itwas Mr Delvile that was dodging us about so? Though I believe, Sir, youthought I had not found you out?ÓÒAnd pray, young man,Ó said Mrs Charlton, much offended by this familiarintrusion, Òhow did you find us out?ÓÒWhy, ma'am, by the luckiest accident in the world! Just as I was ridinginto town, I met the returned chaise that brought you; and I knew thepostilion very well, as I go that road pretty often; so, by the merestchance in the world, I saw him by the light of the moon. And then hetold me where he had set you down.ÓÒAnd pray, Sir,Ó again asked Mrs Charlton, Òwhat was your reason formaking the enquiry?ÓÒWhy, ma'am, I had a little favour to ask of Miss Beverley, that made methink I would take the liberty to call.ÓÒAnd was this time of night, Sir,Ó she returned, Òthe only one you couldchase for that purpose?ÓÒWhy, ma'am, I'll tell you how that was; I did not mean to have calledtill to-morrow morning; but as I was willing to know if the postilionhad given me a right direction, I knocked one soft little knock at thedoor, thinking you might be gone to bed after your journey, merely toask if it was the right house; but when the servant told me there wasa gentleman with you already, I thought there would be no harm in juststepping for a moment up stairs.ÓÒAnd what, Sir,Ó said Cecilia, whom mingled shame and vexation hadhitherto kept silent, Òis your business with me?ÓÒWhy, ma'am, I only just called to give you a direction to a mostexcellent dog-doctor, as we call him, that lives at the corner of--ÓÒA dog-doctor, Sir?Ó repeated Cecilia, Òand what have I to do with anysuch direction?ÓÒWhy you must know, ma'am, I have been in the greatest concernimaginable about that accident which happened to me with the poor littledog, and so--ÓÒWhat little dog, Sir?Ó cried Delvile, who now began to conclude he wasnot sober, Òdo you know what you are talking of?ÓÒYes, Sir, for it was that very little dog you made me drop out of myarms, by which means he broke his other leg.ÓÒI made you drop him?Ó cried Delvile, angrily, ÒI believe, Sir, you hadmuch better call some other time; it does not appear to me that you arein a proper situation for remaining here at present.ÓÒSir, I shall be gone in an instant,Ó answered Morrice, ÒI merely wantedto beg the favour of Miss Beverley to tell that young lady that ownedthe dog, that if she will carry him to this man, I am sure he will makea cure of him.ÓÒCome, Sir,Ó said Delvile, convinced now of his inebriety, Òif youplease we will walk away together.ÓÒI don't mean to take you away, Sir,Ó said Morrice, looking verysignificantly, Òfor I suppose you have not rode so hard to go so soon;but as to me, I'll only write the direction, and be off.ÓDelvile, amazed and irritated at so many following specimens of ignorantassurance, would not, in his present eagerness, have scrupled turninghim out of the house, had he not thought it imprudent, upon such anoccasion, to quarrel with him, and improper, at so late an hour, to beleft behind; he therefore only, while he was writing the direction, toldCecilia, in a low voice, that he would get rid of him and return in aninstant.They then went together; leaving Cecilia in an agony of distresssurpassing all she had hitherto experienced. ÒAh, Mrs Charlton,Ó shecried, Òwhat refuge have I now from ridicule, or perhaps disgrace!Mr Delvile has been detected watching me in disguise! he has beendiscovered at this late hour meeting me in private! The story will reachhis family with all the hyperbole of exaggeration;--how will his noblemother disdain me! how cruelly shall I sink before the severity of hereye!ÓMrs Charlton tried to comfort her, but the effort was vain, and shespent her time in the bitterest repining till eleven o'clock. Delvile'snot returning then added wonder to her sadness, and the impropriety ofhis returning at all so late, grew every instant more glaring.At last, though in great disturbance, and evidently much ruffled inhis temper, he came; ÒI feared,Ó he cried, ÒI had passed the time foradmittance, and the torture I have suffered from being detained hasalmost driven me wild. I have been in misery to see you again,--yourlooks, your manner,--the letter you talk of,--all have filled me withalarm; and though I know not what it is I have to dread, I find itimpossible to rest a moment without some explanation. Tell me, then, whyyou seem thus strange and thus depressed? Tell me what that letter wasto forbid? Tell me any thing, and every thing, but that you repent yourcondescension.ÓÒThat letter,Ó said Cecilia, Òwould have explained to you all. I scarceknow how to communicate its contents; yet I hope you will hear withpatience what I acknowledge I have resolved upon only from necessity.That letter was to tell you that to-morrow we must not meet;--it was toprepare you, indeed, for our meeting, perhaps, never more!ÓÒGracious heaven!Ó exclaimed he, starting, Òwhat is it you mean?ÓÒThat I have made a promise too rash to be kept; that you must pardonme if, late as it is, I retract, since I am convinced it was wrong, andmust be wretched in performing it.ÓConfounded and dismayed, for a moment he continued silent, and thenpassionately called out, ÒWho has been with you to defame me in youropinion? Who has barbarously wronged my character since I left youMonday? Mr Monckton received me coldly,--has he injured me inyour esteem? Tell, tell me but to whom I owe this change, that myvindication, if it restores not your favour, may at least make you ceaseto (missing words) that once I was honoured with some share of it!ÓÒIt wants not to be restored,Ó said Cecilia, with much softness, Òsinceit has never been alienated. Be satisfied that I think of you as Ithought when we last parted, and generously forbear to reproach me,when I assure you I am actuated by principles which you ought not todisapprove.ÓÒAnd are you then, unchanged?Ó cried he, more gently, Òand is youresteem for me still--ÓÒI thought it justice to say so once,Ó cried she, hastily interruptinghim, Òbut exact from me nothing more. It is too late for us now to talkany longer; to-morrow you may find my letter at Mrs Robert's, and that,short as it is, contains my resolution and its cause.ÓÒNever,Ó cried he vehemently, Òcan I quit you without knowing it! Iwould not linger till to-morrow in this suspence to be master of theuniverse!ÓÒI have told it you, Sir, already; whatever is clandestine carries aconsciousness of evil, and so repugnant do I find it to my dispositionand opinions, that till you give me back the promise I so unworthilymade, I must be a stranger to peace, because at war with my own actionsand myself.ÓÒRecover, then, your peace,Ó cried Delvile with much emotion, Òfor Ihere acquit you of all promise!--to fetter, to compel you, were tooinhuman to afford me any happiness. Yet hear me, dispassionately hearme, and deliberate a moment before you resolve upon my exile. Yourscruples I am not now going to combat, I grieve that they are sopowerful, but I have no new arguments with which to oppose them; all Ihave to say, is, that it is now too late for a retreat to satisfy them.ÓÒTrue, Sir, and far too true! yet is it always best to do right, howevertardily; always better to repent, than to grow callous in wrong.ÓÒSuffer not, however, your delicacy for my family to make you forgetwhat is due to yourself as well as to me; the fear of shocking you ledme just now to conceal what a greater fear now urges me to mention. Thehonour I have had in view is already known to many, and in a very shorttime there are none will be ignorant of it. That impudent young man,Morrice, had the effrontery to rally me upon my passion for you,and though I reproved him with great asperity, he followed me into acoffee-house, whither I went merely to avoid him. There I forced myselfto stay, till I saw him engaged with a news-paper, and then, throughvarious private streets and alleys, I returned hither; but judge myindignation, when the moment I knocked at the door, I perceived himagain at my side!ÓÒDid he, then, see you come in?ÓÒI angrily demanded what he meant by thus pursuing me; he verysubmissively begged my pardon, and said he had had a notion I shouldcome back, and had therefore only followed, me to see if he was right!I hesitated for an instant whether to chastise, or confide in him; butbelieving a few hours would make his impertinence immaterial, I didneither,--the door opened, and I came in.ÓHe stopt; but Cecilia was too much shocked to answer him.ÒNow, then,Ó said he, Òweigh your objections against the consequenceswhich must follow. It is discovered I attended you in town; it willbe presumed I had your permission for such attendance; to separate,therefore, now, will be to no purpose with respect to that delicacywhich makes you wish it. It will be food for conjecture, for enquiry,for wonder, almost while both our names are remembered, and while to meit will bring the keenest misery in the severity of my disappointment,it will cast over your own conduct a veil of mystery and obscuritywholly subversive of that unclouded openness, that fair, transparentingenuousness, by which it has hitherto been distinguished.ÓÒAlas, then,Ó said she, Òhow dreadfully have I erred, that whatever pathI now take must lead me wrong!ÓÒYou overwhelm me with grief,Ó cried Delvile, Òby finding you thusdistressed, when I had hoped--Oh cruel Cecilia! how different to thisdid I hope to have met you!--all your doubts settled, all your fearsremoved, your mind perfectly composed, and ready, unreluctantly, toratify the promise with so much sweetness accorded me!--where now arethose hopes!--where now.--ÓÒWhy will you not begone?Ó cried Cecilia, uneasily, Òindeed it is toolate to stay.ÓÒTell me first,Ó cried he, with great energy, Òand let good Mrs Charltonspeak too,--ought not every objection to our union, however potent,to give way, without further hesitation, to the certainty that ourintending it must become public? Who that hears of our meeting inLondon, at such a season, in such circumstances, and at such hours,--ÓÒAnd why,Ó cried Cecilia, angrily, Òdo you mention them, and yet stay?ÓÒI must speak now,Ó answered he with quickness, Òor lose foreverall that is dear to me, and add to the misery of that loss, theheart-piercing reflection of having injured her whom of all the world Imost love, most value, and most revere!ÓÒAnd how injured?Ó cried Cecilia, half alarmed and half displeased;ÒSurely I must strangely have lived to fear now the voice of calumny?ÓÒIf any one has ever,Ó returned he, Òso lived as to dare defy it, MissBeverley is she; but though safe by the established purity of yourcharacter from calumny, there are other, and scarce less invidiousattacks, from which no one is exempt, and of which the refinement, thesensibility of your mind, will render you but the more susceptible;ridicule has shafts, and impertinence has arrows, which though againstinnocence they may be levelled in vain, have always the power ofwounding tranquility.ÓStruck with a truth which she could not controvert, Cecilia sigheddeeply, but spoke not.ÒMr Delvile is right,Ó said Mrs Charlton, Òand though your plan, my dearCecilia, was certainly virtuous and proper, when you set out from Bury,the purpose of your journey must now be made so public, that it will nolonger be judicious nor rational.ÓDelvile poured forth his warmest thanks for this friendly interposition,and then, strengthened by such an advocate, re-urged all his argumentswith redoubled hope and spirit.Cecilia, disturbed, uncertain, comfortless, could frame her mind tono resolution; she walked about the room,deliberated,--determined,--wavered and deliberated again. Delvile thengrew more urgent, and represented so strongly the various mortificationswhich must follow so tardy a renunciation of their intentions, that,terrified and perplexed, and fearing the breach of their union wouldnow be more injurious to her than its ratification, she ceased allopposition to his arguments, and uttered no words but of solicitationthat he would leave her.ÒI will,Ó cried he, ÒI will begone this very moment. Tell me but firstyou will think of what I have said, and refer me not to your letter, butdeign yourself to pronounce my doom, when you have considered if it maynot be softened.ÓTo this she tacitly consented; and elated with fresh rising hope, herecommended his cause to the patronage of Mrs Charlton, and then, takingleave of Cecilia, ÒI go,Ó he said, Òthough I have yet a thousand thingsto propose and to supplicate, and though still in a suspense thatmy temper knows ill how to endure; but I should rather be renderedmiserable than happy, in merely overpowering your reason by entreaty. Ileave you, therefore, to your own reflections; yet remember,--and refusenot to remember with some compunction, that all chance, all possibilityof earthly happiness for me depends upon your decision.ÓHe then tore himself away.Cecilia, shocked at the fatigue she had occasioned her good old friend,now compelled her to go to rest, and dedicated the remaining part of thenight to uninterrupted deliberation.It seemed once more in her power to be mistress of her destiny; but thevery liberty of choice she had so much coveted, now attained, appearedthe most heavy of calamities; since, uncertain even what she ought todo, she rather wished to be drawn than to lead, rather desired to beguided than to guide. She was to be responsible not only to the worldbut to herself for the whole of this momentous transaction, and theterror of leaving either dissatisfied, made independence burthensome,and unlimited power a grievance.The happiness or misery which awaited her resolution were but secondaryconsiderations in the present state of her mind; her consent to aclandestine action she lamented as an eternal blot to her character, andthe undoubted publication of that consent as equally injurious toher fame. Neither retracting nor fulfilling her engagement could nowretrieve what was past, and in the bitterness of regret for the errorshe had committed she thought happiness unattainable for the remainderof her life.In this gloomy despondence passed the night, her eyes never closed, herdetermination never formed. Morning, however, came, and upon somethingto fix was indispensable.She now, therefore, finally employed herself in briefly, comparing thegood with the evil of giving Delvile wholly up, or becoming his forever.In accepting him, she was exposed to all the displeasure of hisrelations, and, which affected her most, to the indignant severity ofhis mother; but not another obstacle could be found that seemed of anyweight to oppose him.In refusing him she was liable to the derision of the world, to sneersfrom strangers, and remonstrances from her friends, to becoming a topicfor ridicule, if not for slander, and an object of curiosity if not ofcontempt.The ills, therefore, that threatened her marriage, though mostafflicting, were least disgraceful, and those which awaited its breach,if less serious, were more mortifying.At length, after weighing every circumstance as well as her perturbedspirits would permit, she concluded that so late to reject him mustbring misery without any alleviation, while accepting him, thoughfollowed by wrath and reproach, left some opening for future hope, andsome prospect of better days.To fulfil, therefore, her engagement was her final resolution.*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CECILIA; OR, MEMOIRS OF AN HEIRESS Ñ VOLUME 2 ***    Updated editions will replace the previous oneÑthe old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the UnitedStates without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project GutenbergªProject Gutenbergª is synonymous with the free distribution ofelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety ofcomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. Itexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donationsfrom people in all walks of life.Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with theassistance they need are critical to reaching Project GutenbergªÕsgoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergª collection willremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the ProjectGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secureand permanent future for Project Gutenbergª and futuregenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, seeSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive FoundationThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of thestate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the InternalRevenue Service. The FoundationÕs EIN or federal tax identificationnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted byU.S. federal laws and your stateÕs laws.The FoundationÕs business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and upto date contact information can be found at the FoundationÕs websiteand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contactSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project GutenbergLiterary Archive FoundationProject Gutenbergª depends upon and cannot survive without widespreadpublic support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SENDDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular statevisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donationmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. Todonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenbergª electronic worksProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the ProjectGutenbergª concept of a library of electronic works that could befreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced anddistributed Project Gutenbergª eBooks with only a loose network ofvolunteer support.Project Gutenbergª eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright inthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do notnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paperedition.Most people start at our website which has the main PG searchfacility: www.gutenberg.org.This website includes information about Project Gutenbergª,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
